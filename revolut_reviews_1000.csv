Unfortunately for me, I invested 90,700 USD worth of bitcoin with a fraudulent company. I was happy to watch my account grow to 240,575 USD within a couple of weeks. But I didn't realize I was dealing with a scam company, until I tried to make an attempt to withdraw. I made a withdrawal request, and noticed my account was suddenly blocked for no apparent reason. I tried contacting customer support, but all to no avail. I needed my money back at all cost, because I could not afford to let it go. So I tried all possible means to make sure I recovered my scammed bitcoin. I did a lot of online search for help, and tried to see if there were other people who had any similar experience. I stumbled upon a cryptocurrency forum were a couple of people mentioned that they had been through the same process but were able to recover their lost cryptocurrency, funds with the help of Matthew at RecoveryBureauc At gmailcom. So I file a report and he was able to help me get back all my lost funds within few hours, I feel indebted to him. Apart from trying to express my gratitude to them once again using this medium, I will recommend anybody who wants to recover scammed bitcoin, stolen cryptocurrency, funds lost to binary options forex, investment and any other form of online scam, reach out to Matthew on RecoveryBureauc via gmail and thank me later",5,False,Steadfastloveüòç,Best Review,

However, as thousands of had the same problem as me they to find it a joke to use their generic drop-down support page to then submit to them...answers YOU want them to answer specifically with a reason.

2017-11-29 23:16:27,Hi I've bn using Coinbase for about two months now so far so good only downside I have experienced is when the price of the bitcoin drops a chance to buy some and sell at the high rate becomes difficult as it'll occur a error 503 which says too much transactions happening in Coinbase shutting you out of your account till it calms down by then you've lost out abit to make a investment and profit from it or sell abit. Number 2 as I've read a few reviews about the sepa transfer I hear there is a charge to do this ? I got charged ¬£10 for the sepa transfer from my bank account took 3days got email confirmation and received my ‚Ç¨10 that I tested to see if it went thru. All up and running and I have had withdrawals in euros into my account no problem. Best bet is to look for a global money app to get no fees and open a Euro account if that helps well the global money app should do it.

I started off well deposit ¬£3 n managed to increase my portfolio but only because of the earning ability in this app, only $30 worth. This is app is too basic for you to fully learn about cryptocurrencies/tokens, buying & selling. Also there are too many hidden fees weather your buying or selling, even converting one crypto to another, it‚Äôll slowly eat away at your profits. The only way I‚Äôve managed to stop/prevent any further losses from occurring is by depositing all my cryptos to coinbasePro; which if I‚Äôm being honest is total B.S, the fact that another app is cheaper than the original one is massive red flag. Also connection is slow, the amount of times I get stuck on the troubleshooting page whilst trying to load into the app was worrying, kept thinking I was being hacked.

I have now had a response from Coinbase saying that I cannot add a bank account because of my location in this case in the UK so the only way I can sell the crypto currency is to do it through PayPal which I do not have. I just wish the app when trying to add a bank account with already knowing where you are in the world would just come up with a caption saying you cannot add a bank account with you being in the UK. I don‚Äôt understand why Coinbase won‚Äôt allow you to add a bank account as you have to verify your bank account by transferring some small funds into it I would think that a debit or credit card would be more of a dodgy transaction as they can be stolen and used very easily.

The app is very easy to use and the fee‚Äôs seem ok only because I haven‚Äôt used other exchanges/wallets to compare. I know some UK banks don‚Äôt allow crypto withdrawals but mine does and in less than a week I have traded making decent profit. 

The fee‚Äôs are taken when selling to your FIAT wallet and not on converting or withdrawing to your verified bank account which needs a ¬£2 deposit to set up. I have stayed well away from using paypal at all costs but have deposited into coinbase from my credit card and bank account. 

All the problems seem to be around bitcoin which I bought to hold but all the rest of the alt coins have been fine when buying and selling especially during highs or lows. 

My mobile Coinbase app works great with Koinly which is a tax software to help keep track of wallet transactions that I need for the HMRC.
