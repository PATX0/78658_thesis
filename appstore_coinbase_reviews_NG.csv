Unfortunately for me, I invested 90,700 USD
worth of bitcoin with a fraudulent company. I was happy to watch my account grow to 240,575 USD within a couple of weeks. But I didn't realize I was dealing with a scam company, until tried to make an attempt to withdraw. I made a withdrawal request, and noticed my account was suddenly blocked for no apparent reason. I tried contacting customer support, but all to no avail. I needed my money back at all cost, because I could not afford to let it go. So tried all possible means to make sure recovered my scammed bitcoin. I did a lot of online search for help, and tried to see if there were other people who had any similar experience. I stumbled upon a cryptocurrency forum were a couple of people mentioned that they had been through the same process but were able to recover their lost cryptocurrency, funds with the help of Ganesh
Theowletcryptotrade At gmailcom . So I file a report and he was able to help me get back all my lost funds within few hours I feel indebted to him.

Please use your authenticator app for codes instead\n-Due to issues with the SMS network itself, codes may not get delivered to everyone. You may want to instead use an authenticator app to complete this step, since they don't require internet connectivity or SMS coverage\n-Your SMS inbox may be full. Try deleting some messages from your inbox and request another code\n-After several requests to resend the SMS code, our system may temporarily stop sending them as a security measure. After 24 hours we'll resume sending codes via SMS. If you've already waited 24 hours and still aren't receiving the codes, check with your phone carrier to see if they're blocking our SMS messages\n\nFor more on this, kindly visit: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/managing-my-account/get-back-into-my-account/2-step-verification-troubleshooting\n\nFor further assistance, contact us via: https://help.coinbase.com/en/community-support"", 'modified': '2023-01-07T12:10:54Z'}"
