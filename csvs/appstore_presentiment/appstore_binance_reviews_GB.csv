2021-04-10 14:05:49,I’ve recently got into cryptocurrency trading over the last few months and binance by far is the best free platform to use. Yesterday morning before my early shift at work I went to set a buy limit on a currency incase it went down during my shift but with me being very tired I accidentally set the buy limit at 1.65 instead of 1.165; Instantly I lost 300 pounds on my investment due to my own carelessness and I was deeply upset. To my delight when I opened the app today I still held my crypto which was worth 300 pounds less than I initially had due to my error but I always held 300 pounds worth of USDT which Binance generously gifted back to me after clearing seeing the mistake I made. This isn’t the first time they’ve taken care of me and their security features and compatibility with crypto wallets makes Binance the clear cut choice out of the apps available to begin trading with cryptocurrency in my opinion.,5,False,gaigai26363,Amazing customer service!,

It has a good newbie option and more detailed platform for more experienced users. Things generally went okay for a month until I fast-paid some funds from my bank account that did not arrive in my Binance account. Usually funds arrive within the hour. However this one deposit did not arrive. Over the following 5 days of following up with email and getting repeated automated email responses, I’ve had to join a queue with 700+ people on a list to chat with customer support after dealing with a rubbish chatbot. Wait time 2hrs 30 minutes. 
Problem not resolved, as they cant find my funds even though it has left my bank. So I was told to go to my bank which I’ve now done and awaiting for some sort of resolution.

After passing all the verification it asked for, I decided to deposit my monies in to trade. They offer a FASTER PAYMENT option which enables traders to transfer monies to their designated account in Uk and supposedly start trading straight. 
After being confirmed through their hellishly long verification process and getting confirmation from their relevant team that the monies have hit their account and it’s in process. This all happened on 08 feb 2021. I could see on the portal that the money I sent is in process and to date it’s processing. 
In the process I tried buying crypto through 3 different bank cards and accounts which binance wouldn’t allow. Since that day I’ve been trying to reach their support team and there is no way one can get connected to a human there. Opened about 100 tickets and no reply to even one.

Contacted Visa with no results, they gave me number that was completely automated and I got nowhere. Next was the bank I send my money to and results were similar. At that point I just counted it as loss but as last resort I contacted Binance. Had to wait for reply around 2 weeks but I got FULLY REFUNDED without being asked any questions!

Highly recommended. 🙌Stop using banks start using Binance. Additionally you will get 2% cash back for any purchase if you stake just 1 Binance coin.

Few tips: 

If you have a problem with them don’t open 100 tickets just wait patiently they will reply. I used Binance for over a year and never had a problem. 

Another thing is if you can’t make credit card purchase it’s not Binance that’s stopping you, it’s your Bank believe it or not. If your payment is processing and doesn’t land in Binance it’s still your own Bank again. I suggest considering to contact your bank and ask why they withholding payments. Been there, done that.

Their solution? “Convert you cash into crypto and sell via P2P” what this does mean? Ah yes the conversion of my cash will mean that Binance earns more money in fees.

Well I’m honestly sick of the verification issues this app in isolation has.

These always seem to be during market volatility so I assume failed verification is more truthfully oversubscribed servers but I’d prefer honesty if that’s the case.

2021-10-16 10:45:00,"Terrible company. Might as well burn your money. 

I lost my job over covid. 
String of bad luck. 
Had $150 left in my crypto, put it into a futures order on BNB. Binance’s crypto. 
Within a day it had jumped to a record level. 

I had made over $5000. I honestly couldn’t believe it. I could restart my life. 

However when I tried to put in an order to sell. Nothing would appear. At this point I could see my money slowly getting less and less. So I tried again. Nothing. The tracker was working so internet was ok. 
Then all of a sudden my sell orders went in. My order was now a short. 
Put in an order to just cancel it out. 
Nothing. 

Later. Some of the orders were going through but from earlier. But now I couldn’t see them. I had to try and guess what orders were going through. None of the orders to settle would appear. The slider and pull down menus would stick. Creating incorrect orders I now couldn’t see. 

The help / chat box said “help” it did not exist. 

Then I see there an announcement that there are network issues on the futures network. Also weeks later it’s shown there were bugs in the app. 

Not surprising I lost all my $5k

I showed Binance screen shots, told them to look up the futures network issues at that time, asked about reports of app bugs. 
My response was after 3 months of messages. Sorry. We can’t help. 

They really really don’t care about you. Just to take your money. Their system and app broke, and cost me $5k 
Their response was. It was potential profit they can not be held responsible. As I made lots of orders it shows there was no problems. I couldn’t make correct orders. Orders made were not visible. 

If you go on reddit. They have a team to delete messages that describe systems issues, app issues, lost money. They may leave up one or two. But mine were deleted, reposts were deleted and I was told if I continued to post about my issues I would be banned from their group. Others I messaged were in the same boat some losing much more than me. I would check the next day and their posts were gone too. Imagine having a team that doesn’t help but deletes message showing the company in a bad light. 

Do not use this company. 
This is your money. Do you really want a company that if the network crashes and the app stops working just say. Sorry. Can’t help? If your bank turned round and said. After their network wasn’t working and app was glitching, sorry all your money is gone. There is nothing more we can do. Then have no customer service in place. You reach out of social media and they delete your posts. What would you do?

Here's a bit of insider advice: make sure to use the code KL72S4XS when signing up. It's not just any code; it's your golden ticket to a 10% discount on commissions and some fantastic bonuses for your initial trades.

What really sets Binance apart are the fees – they're incredibly competitive. With spot trading fees starting at a mere 0.1%, and even more discounts when you use BNB, it's a deal that's hard to beat. And for the high rollers, their VIP levels offer fees that are so low, you'll be doing a double-t​​ce.

Binance isn't just about trading, though. Their Binance Convert feature is a game-changer, allowing for zero-fee conversions.
