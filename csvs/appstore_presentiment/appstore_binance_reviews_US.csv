There are various investment recovery companies, but you need to ensure that you hire a legitimate one. They must have extensive background in handling binary options scams.

Extremely annoying when I want to check bollingers on the graph and I need to sit through a loading screen then when I go back to the trade it‚Äôs already a different price. It‚Äôd be even better if you could buy and sell on the same page as the graph without needing to switch tabs. Fixed 25, 50, 75, 100% buttons to buy and sell seem a little ridiculous considering if I switch tabs I need to re enter the exact amount I want to buy at, by that time the price is already changed. Custom buttons would be nice so we can at least get into the trade within a minute considering the long loading time from the graph. If you‚Äôre holding onto coins for a longer period of time this app is great, if you‚Äôre trying to scalp crypto this apps slow loading times and lack of memory to what you last typed on top of the fees will bleed you dry and assure your quick trades turn into quick losses. If you manage to read the chart quick enough, type in your price quick enough, and get your order filled, you can only hope that it went through the system and actually works because at least 15% of the time you don‚Äôt even have your order queued. From my opinion this app is just here to take your money through fees and is only used because there are no other apps like this on the IOS market as of now.

Binance is the best exchange for two reasons;

1) while they are a for-profit dex; their charity initiatives such as Binance angels and their interactivity with the community make them bar none number #1 in customer support; additionally CZ will charge a simple fee of $1 to list a new prospective tokens if it meets their criteria for supply & demand amongst the community.

2) perhaps the single most important reason for ‚Äúthe rise of Binance‚Äù and why most traders (including myself) jumped ship from bittrex or whatever other dex at the time for Binance: NOMINAL, LOW FEES! 

‚Ä¢ Their ability to market themselves as the leading exchange with fees that are AFFORDABLE and don‚Äôt cost an arm and a leg for each transaction: especially with the way in which BNB cleverly provides incentives for users to purchase the token to make such fees almost nonexistent.

I think that Binance is without a doubt the best dex and that‚Äôs mainly due to the genuine wholehearted interest of the lead developers to ensure that global integration and not sole individual profit motive is prioritized, therefore  ensuring their success for themselves as a leading global market DEX for years to come.",5,False,Binance has come a long way.,Ahmad tarabichi,

Thought it was just some kind of bug, so I attempted again. Same thing happens.

Reached out to support, told them the issue, they told me to make sure to confirm the email. I was fairly certain I had already done this, but I did it again and it seemed to work.

Attempted to withdraw $1000 again since I only have until 7/20/23 to withdraw my USD now. 

7/18/23
Withdraw failed.
