I wrote that to support that they have significant performance issues and thoroughly described when and how this happens, the technical support didn‚Äôt answer; well done. Secondly, I wanted to delete my account. They have a page on the help centre ‚ÄúHow can I close my account?‚Äù which says go to your activity and click ‚Äúclose account‚Äù, then there has been a modal dialogue which required to input my password. Then I was redirected to settings page, and I can still sign in into my account.
