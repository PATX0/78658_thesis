The ONLY major exchange I have found, available for use in the US, to offer derivatives (long/short w/ leverage) and a plethora of leveraged swaps. They have FREE TO USE, IN EXCHANGE trading bots!!!! no API keys or suspect integration. Very easy to set up, and you can have 10 running simultaneously. Not to mention the Staking options have grown a bunch just in the past few months alone. I‚Äôve been hounding the team to develop a desktop app, but I mainly use the web client as a 32‚Äô screen is a lil easier to view charts on, as opposed to a phoneüòÇ A few things I would like to see: - We need order-triggers-order and order-cancels-order options for trading and futures! - Make a desktop app! - The ability to do derivative future strategies (like a straddle or straggle) would also be amazing considering arbitrage portfolios are a thing now. You can currently run a bot straddle strategy, but its not quite the same! Overall, 9.5/10 UI is gorgeous and night mode rocks Coin variety is top notch Want to go short?

When trading futures, it feels like my trades specifically are picked and wiped out and then immediately trend the direction I bet on. When I place a limit order, I can see the price start to fluctuate as soon as I type an order that would be fulfilled in my favor. I have placed opposite sided trades on a second device and BOTH sides were SHORTED on a volume of maybe 100 coins of a sub dollar coin within 15 minutes. I have screen recorded trading showing how the app practically tracks my inputs since they also know my exact percentages and what it would take to wipe out a trade. The trading bot is also worthless. You pay more in GRID gains than you make no matter how you set it up, and the bots also contribute to the problem with futures. 

Stay away from this horrible trading app. You can only make money holding (unless they take your coin off the market then your holdings are gone too), which I also bet they use to manipulate prices when you‚Äôre not using.

But Kucoin is beginning to severely worry me. This is a trading app, not a HODLing app. 
Therefor you need to be able to trade. Kucoin has started crashing at very crucial times. I lost over 30% of my portfolio because I tried to initiate a sell and Kucoin‚Äôs network went down for the 6th time that week because it got a little busy and had to do it‚Äôs job a little harder. poof. gone.  6 months of savings and trading gone in 20 minutes, not from a bad trade.

People are putting their faith in crypto currency because they are sick of banks and conglomerates incompetence and greed losing their money for them. I‚Äôm those 20 minutes. Everything is up to date. Kucoin simply is failing when it gets busy and people are losing 10s of thousands as a result.

Also when using futures, it‚Äôs takes a while to submits orders, and sometimes the position disappears for few seconds until close out the app or refresh.

2023-05-13 12:55:22,"I have been trading for years. TA is useless in this considering it can pump and dump at any moment. ONE MAJOR ISSUE, Kucoin charges insane fees. They will take %50 of your profit and they do not tell you before you execute the trade how much they will take. MARGIN SCAM. Be careful with margin trading on here. If you are on the right side of your trade they slowly lower your margin as the trade goes in your favor. However, if you are on the wrong side of. A trade they increase the margin as it goes against you! This is there way of minimizing your gains and maximizing your losses. This is how they make money. So they have a big incentive to make you lose which could be a massive conflict of interest. Be careful on this app ***** UPDATE: Kucoin sees your stop losses and take profits.

BUT there has been numerous situations including the most recent leading me to leave a negative review. KuCoin buy/sell/market orders will sometimes not complete or go through. This requires you to refresh the app, wasting time in between your trades. What is the point of trading on an app where I have to refresh one to several times before I can make my trade.

And it goes on and on.  It is pretty ridiculous. 

Then there is the fact that I've lost over $300 in withdraws that never arrived in the wallets they were sent too, even though the addresses were LITERALLY copy and pasted.

I may have a few orders placed in the .25 range, so it‚Äôs difficult to find a specific order in that range when they all just say .25. I would assume this has to be a pretty easy fix. I also have another suggestion that would be helpful to me and I‚Äôm sure to others‚Ä¶ It would be a VERY nice feature to be able to set up price alert pushes or at the very least to receive a push notification when one of our orders is filled. I would definitely give this app 5-stars if the above suggestions were implemented. In fact, I would even pay a subscription fee to be able to have push notifications.

But I didn't realize I was dealing with a scam company, until I tried to make an attempt to withdraw. I made a withdrawal request, and noticed my account was suddenly blocked for no apparent reason. I tried contacting customer support, but all to no avail. I needed my money back at all cost, because I could not afford to let it go. So I tried all possible means to make sure I recovered my scammed bitcoin. I did a lot of online search for help, and tried to see if there were other people who had any similar experience. I stumbled upon a cryptocurrency forum were a couple of people mentioned that they had been through the same process but were able to recover their lost cryptocurrency funds with the help of crimesnetcyber @ gmail So I file a report on crimesnetcyber @ gmail and he was able to help me get back all my lost funds within 2 weeks I feel indebted to him.

2021-05-05 19:11:16,"Read the reviews and you‚Äôll quickly notice a common theme.. user error and inexperience. Some guy complaining about bitcoin transfer not showing up 45 minutes later... bitcoin transactions can take an hour, sometimes more. Depends on the fee you paid to send and how busy the network is. You obviously never sent btc before. Another guy playing with margin, which is basically gambling by borrowing using your assets/crypto as collateral. You‚Äôre playing a dangerous game playing with margin, because you‚Äôre liable for losses when the market dips. You‚Äôre trying to make a profit by GAMBLING that the price will go up. If it doesn‚Äôt and you lose a certain percentage, the asset automatically sells itself to cover losses. This guy went ALL IN with more than he was comfortable losing, that‚Äôs YOUR FAULT! Why not just let your coins sit and grow? He lost his coins because the market dipped. You don‚Äôt play with that, it‚Äôs not because the app closed. That‚Äôs dishonest interpretation of what happened. This is exchange has been awesome so far. It‚Äôs not the A-tier exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, but it‚Äôs a solid B. The A-tier exchanges simply have more volume pumping through them, but in terms of usability and utility, ease of use, etc I give KuCoin an A+. Ppl who have left negative reviews are ALL mostly new to this space, chasing fomo, and they CLEARLY don‚Äôt understand this game yet. KuCoin has security hold protocols in place, especially for new users to avoid fraud. They don‚Äôt let you move assets right away when you make changes to your email or change a password, that lasts 24 hours or so. It gives the owner a chance to react to security alert emails/texts if anyone were to gain access to your account. These are smart moves to protect your account, crying about it just shows inexperience. I love KuCoin. It‚Äôs a great exchange for US investors. It‚Äôs not technically set up for US yet, but it doesn‚Äôt prevent us from investing. The only limitation is that you‚Äôre limited to withdrawing 2 btc per day, and for most ppl that‚Äôs plenty given we‚Äôre not all moving $120k per day!! Too much complaining from ppl who need to look at their own mistakes, and blame their own lack of knowledge/research.

You can trade, buy, withdraw INSTANTLY!!! No waiting for days or your account getting locked up for ‚Äúsecurity reasons‚Äù!!! KuCoin is the top exchange to use and they have such an amazing team that actually cares about their product & services. There are many similar to KuCoin but there really is only one like it and that‚Äôs being them ONLY. Give them a shot and you will see why they are leagues better than Coinbase, Kraken, etc. They also have their own NON-Custodial wallet with plenty of top of the line security, they offer staking & lending of popular coins, & you can trade with the lowest fees ever. Take back control of your assets and stop waiting forever and ever for other exchanges just for them to eventually bar your from your own assets. It‚Äôs been happening to the mightiest of exchanges so always be on the lookout and always remember, NOT YOUR KEYS THEN IT REALLY ISN‚ÄôT YOUR CRYPTO.

I tried to tell them the app was literally telling me I wasn‚Äôt verified and that it had been rejected, but they never responded, so I opened a new ticket and got the same response, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre verified, you should be able to sell‚Äù and never received any help.  I finally managed to get my money out only after moving my USDS out of KuCoin, transferring it into my Coinbase wallet, in which KuCoin charged me almost $30 in fees to move $240 out of my account.  Only once I got it to Coinbase was I able to sell it for USD, and finally get my money back to my bank account.  Sorry for the long review but please be aware, and if you are itching to use the app solely for crypto futures, I‚Äôd put your money somewhere else, such as options on TD ameritrade or futures on /ES or such.",1,-0.4285,bad

2021-05-10 11:58:39,"Update: Changing to one star because tech support closed my ticket without solving my issue. They seem to have an automated ticket system that failed to acknowledge several of my email responses. I think I was able to finally get a message through to the system after they marked it as solved, but I now have little confidence that I‚Äôll get any more help on my issue. 

I‚Äôm sort of a newbie to crypto trading, but I started using KuCoin to trade some X Y O that I mined in another app.  The KuCoin iOS (iPhone) app works fine.  All of the features function as described, and I have never experienced a crash or lost currency due to any malfunctions.  I‚Äôve lost on bad trades, but that‚Äôs another story.  My biggest problem with the iOS app is size of the text.  They try to cram so much info onto the screen that the text get‚Äôs really small and hard to read.  SO, I decided to try the iPadOS version of the app on my 2020 iPad Pro.  The text is definitely easier to read, but the app only works in portrait view.  It will not rotate to landscape.  In that sense, it feels very much like an iPhone app that was hastily ported to iPad format.  Also, and this is the biggest issue for me, the trading bot simply does not work on the iPad.  I have waited weeks for responses from tech support, and the answer is simply to reinstall the app and try again.  I‚Äôve tried that a number of times with no success.  All I get is an error message that it failed to load. I would really like to see landscape mode with full screen charts (like the website) on the iPad app, and it would good to get the bot working on the iPad.  If they do that, I‚Äôll revise my rating.",1,0.8843,very_good

I have NEVER used the website through a PC to place any trades, deposits - anything! I am accustomed to the mobile app, I like the mobile app and I will ONLY use the mobile app. At this point, unfortunately, I will be leaving the KuCoin platform. There was a time just weeks ago where I thought that this was the best cryptocurrency exchange that existed. Now? Due to this very, very annoying issue that should not even be existent, I am no longer a fan or supporter of KuCoin. I‚Äôll be leaving the Reddit community and any other forum/platform/exchange associated in any way with the company.

I want to add that, particularly through Reddit, I have been an avid supporter of the platform. I‚Äôve even had several short conversations with Johnny KuCoin who is the CEO of the company. He‚Äôs a very nice man and has always put my interest first in amending any problems I have had - which admittedly are rare. Upon emailing the company today though? I was given a response that essentially, in other words, said ‚Äúoh well, you can‚Äôt use your phone I guess! Go buy a laptop and use our exchange through our website.‚Äù

This is a joke. Please, fix the problem or you lie at risk of losing supportive members of your community - the community you have worked tirelessly to build! 

I hope that Johnny_Kucoin sees this message. I hope that someone steps up to resolve the issue before KuCoin loses its ground to stand on. I checked social media and I am not the only person with the problem. As a matter of fact - and although I didn‚Äôt read them all - I picked through lists of articles/forum topics surrounding this dilemma that must have been numbered in the hundreds, if not thousands!

This is something that should be at the TOP of the priority list and I hope that KuCoin is able to prove why they are so beloved by the cryptocurrency trading community. Thank you for your time spent in reading this message. I know it was long but I wanted to make sure that all of the information given was clear. I look forward to hearing back from you as well as seeing this issue resolved.

2021-05-10 20:58:07,"I have NEVER written up a review for an app but I felt I had to, not because I want to.

TL;DR: Fix your 401 Network connection issues!! I lose money because I can‚Äôt close positions if I can‚Äôt connect and therefore can‚Äôt recommend!!!

Before I joined the app I shopped around to make sure the exchange/app was reliable and was a good experience. I saw raving reviews and was thoroughly impressed with how they handled the situation when they got hacked a few years ago. So I downloaded the app and signed up.

Initially the app is a confusing experience and not user friendly. However, as you navigate the app and spend more time in it the app makes more sense. The app and platform was a real 5 stars for me and I was recommending it to friends. I noticed however that every once in a while I would get 401 Errors or Network Connection issues. This happened sporadically and wasn‚Äôt game breaking.

What brings the app down to a 1 star is the fact that these errors have gotten worse and more pervasive even as I tried to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù my connection. I would try going to areas with better reception, no luck. I would restart the app, works maybe 20% of the time. I would restart my phone, works once and then stops working after you load the app again.

I had a position that, while risky, I was aware that it could have been liquidated. KuCoin sent me a message saying I was in danger of getting liquidated as the position had dropped. Great, but I couldn‚Äôt get do anything in the app to respond as it couldn‚Äôt  connect even though I had service. By the time I got on, through my computer, my position had already been liquidated and I lost all of my money. 

It has gotten so bad that I‚Äôm now not just considering but will move to a different platform. Fix it please, I really like the platform but the connection issues make it absolutely unusable and unreliable. Time is money and these connection issues cost me a lot of time and money.

Other issues include: Slow 2FA SMS, can‚Äôt go through KYC to unlock rest of features, missing features or not well explained, and generally slow loading times.",1,-0.9318,very_bad
2022-12-13 12:19:51,"I‚Äôve used pretty much every trading app out there and have been trading crypto for several years now. Of all the trading apps this one is by far the shadiest and I assume just preys on people who don‚Äôt understand the difference between limit and market orders. 

Whenever I place a limit order the purchase order will fill 1% + every single time. This basically means they are skimming (stealing) 1% on every order. This may not seem like a lot but keep in mind that if you use margin, say 20x you are already -20% as soon as your order fills. This is the first way I noticed this app stealing from me. The second way was on stop losses. 

The stop loss feature is labeled just that. It is not labeled a Limit Stop Loss. Multiple times my trigger price would hit and the stop loss would not trigger at which point I was liquidated shortly after. I split test this and it happened multiple times. 

The final way this platform robbed me was when I tried to get my money off the exchange and back to my Binance account. The transfer out would not and still will not go through after multiple attempts. Again, I‚Äôm not ignorant to trading and crypto wallet / platform transfers. This app isn‚Äôt having errors it‚Äôs designed to do all of these things and I‚Äôm sure scrapes millions per week from users who don‚Äôt understand functions. 

Lastly when I inquire for help all I get is automated responses that are absolutely useless and don‚Äôt even add the inquiry. Luckily I only moved like 1k over here to try it out simply because they had some very low cap projects I was interested in but that‚Äôs still a 1k loss now even though I didn‚Äôt loose it trading. Please don‚Äôt use with extreme caution and don‚Äôt move any funds over here you‚Äôre not willing to flush down the toilet.

They manipulate their charts and their prices not to mention the percentage increase or decrease for 24 hour periods most of their contracts are front running especially their KuCoin smart chain House token. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on their futures or margin trading. Let‚Äôs just put it this way any money you put in there do not expect to get back. It is specifically designed to make sure that you withdraw zero money. The futures market or downright criminal. I‚Äôve been trading futures for over 20 years very successfully seeing as it‚Äôs part of my career, and I‚Äôve never seen anything as efficient as this app for robbing you of your money. Their liquidation engine is literally just a bought that tracks your orders and what it would take to liquidate you and even if you close out in a profitable spot you will come up negative. 100% of the time.

 These guys are a Hong Kong headquartered company, these Chinese nationals will steal your money and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. I have also had a referral of mine lose $250,000 because they locked him out of his account. $250K gone because they wanted to take it. 

I have several videos of questionable, at best, price action & also have several screenshots & testimony from a close friend who lost $250K trying to talk to customer service to get money back. I can verify anything & everything that I have said here with pictures, correspondence from KuCoin, and verification on block chain. 

Do yourself a favor especially if you are a US citizen, do not put any money in this exchange. Unless you want to lose it.

2021-08-11 15:04:44,"honestly i have been using this app for some time . and every day i struggle with the app not loading properly . it always gives me ""mapping_error "" and ""network loading failure""  constantly . and if u press refresh it wont load . i can have the best and worst connection, and it still will do this to me. on all my different mobile devices. 
the other factor of futures limit and market order slippage is disastrous . if u want to lose money put a limit or market sell and you'll see how much the brokerage swipes from you, in comparison to what it says in writing as you create the order 
for example if u sell market sell the position in profit +100$ , you might get 35-60$ of that. 
if u limit sell, it will always be in the brokerage favor , at a lower (long ) and higher (short ) number so its always going to sell , but will eat you up heavy. 
if the limit order is sold for 100+ profit @ a 12$ coin for example  , u put a sell limit for 12$ and it wont take it (it will take forever , or  most likely never hit it) ,then the price goes down and you miss out on the gains, having to re enter a way lower limit order, or even having to market sell for a loss.  if you allow the limit order sold by the brokerage (by using 100/75/50/25%) it will place the sell in the brokerage favor , and once it treks opposite some , it will trigger . the amount that it says you are in profit or loss is extremely different than what you actually received (not in your favor) . it does state there is a kucoin transaction fee but not nearly as much as what u lost in the trade. 
when the market is going balistic in volatility , the app starts to act up, and its always in kucoins favor. 
this app is good for long term holds , but please when u are trading futures put a tight solid stop loss and take profit. dont be greedy , you will lose your sh*t with this app",2,0.8781,very_good
