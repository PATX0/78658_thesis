2021-04-10 14:05:49,I‚Äôve recently got into cryptocurrency trading over the last few months and binance by far is the best free platform to use. Yesterday morning before my early shift at work I went to set a buy limit on a currency incase it went down during my shift but with me being very tired I accidentally set the buy limit at 1.65 instead of 1.165; Instantly I lost 300 pounds on my investment due to my own carelessness and I was deeply upset. To my delight when I opened the app today I still held my crypto which was worth 300 pounds less than I initially had due to my error but I always held 300 pounds worth of USDT which Binance generously gifted back to me after clearing seeing the mistake I made. This isn‚Äôt the first time they‚Äôve taken care of me and their security features and compatibility with crypto wallets makes Binance the clear cut choice out of the apps available to begin trading with cryptocurrency in my opinion.,5,False,gaigai26363,Amazing customer service!,

Problem not resolved, as they cant find my funds even though it has left my bank. So I was told to go to my bank which I‚Äôve now done and awaiting for some sort of resolution.

2021-02-21 11:27:09,"Binance is user unfriendly, your customer support needs a major improvement. It would be much better for your system to support all enquiries concerning difficulties using your system and help in buying cryptos. It would even be better if there is someone you can communicate directly with and not to communicate with an ibot. I understand your need to keep costs down and earn more profit but PLEASE HELP us by providing us with a top of the range and a just customer services similar to that of Hargreaves Lansdown a company based in the UK. Their support system includes 3 different telephone numbers to different departments which includes their HelpDesk and their Stockbrokers. This company provides 100 percent fantastic customer services, it is a pity they do not operate also as a crypto exchange. 
I had difficulties sending my XRP to my wallet because your system asked me to provide a ‚Äútag‚Äùnumber. I was not able to do this. I searched all areas to find help but up till now I have found no help but interestingly I came across many people online experiencing the same problem. There are many other cryptos that is not listed under your ‚Äúbuy with debit or credit card‚Äù that I would like to buy that I cannot buy due to your user unfriendly system. I often have to turn to UTUBE for help but i do not always find all the help that I need because they will be talking about USBINANCE which is different to UK set up BINANCE exchange online, they have slightly different features which can be a major barrier for those based in the UK please help and make your system more user friendly. Also your system only allow you to view the current value of six of your cryptos. It then tells you that you have 3 plus to which you cannot access their current values.

2021-10-16 10:45:00,"Terrible company. Might as well burn your money. 

I lost my job over covid. 
String of bad luck. 
Had $150 left in my crypto, put it into a futures order on BNB. Binance‚Äôs crypto. 
Within a day it had jumped to a record level. 

I had made over $5000. I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe it. I could restart my life. 

However when I tried to put in an order to sell. Nothing would appear. At this point I could see my money slowly getting less and less. So I tried again. Nothing. The tracker was working so internet was ok. 
Then all of a sudden my sell orders went in. My order was now a short. 
Put in an order to just cancel it out. 
Nothing. 

Later. Some of the orders were going through but from earlier. But now I couldn‚Äôt see them. I had to try and guess what orders were going through. None of the orders to settle would appear. The slider and pull down menus would stick. Creating incorrect orders I now couldn‚Äôt see. 

The help / chat box said ‚Äúhelp‚Äù it did not exist. 

Then I see there an announcement that there are network issues on the futures network. Also weeks later it‚Äôs shown there were bugs in the app. 

Not surprising I lost all my $5k

I showed Binance screen shots, told them to look up the futures network issues at that time, asked about reports of app bugs. 
My response was after 3 months of messages. Sorry. We can‚Äôt help. 

They really really don‚Äôt care about you. Just to take your money. Their system and app broke, and cost me $5k 
Their response was. It was potential profit they can not be held responsible. As I made lots of orders it shows there was no problems. I couldn‚Äôt make correct orders. Orders made were not visible. 

If you go on reddit. They have a team to delete messages that describe systems issues, app issues, lost money. They may leave up one or two. But mine were deleted, reposts were deleted and I was told if I continued to post about my issues I would be banned from their group. Others I messaged were in the same boat some losing much more than me. I would check the next day and their posts were gone too. Imagine having a team that doesn‚Äôt help but deletes message showing the company in a bad light. 

Do not use this company. 
This is your money. Do you really want a company that if the network crashes and the app stops working just say. Sorry. Can‚Äôt help? If your bank turned round and said.

You reach out of social media and they delete your posts. What would you do?

Here's a bit of insider advice: make sure to use the code KL72S4XS when signing up. It's not just any code; it's your golden ticket to a 10% discount on commissions and some fantastic bonuses for your initial trades.

What really sets Binance apart are the fees ‚Äì they're incredibly competitive. With spot trading fees starting at a mere 0.1%, and even more discounts when you use BNB, it's a deal that's hard to beat. And for the high rollers, their VIP levels offer fees that are so low, you'll be doing a double-t‚Äã‚Äãce.

Binance isn't just about trading, though. Their Binance Convert feature is a game-changer, allowing for zero-fee conversions.
