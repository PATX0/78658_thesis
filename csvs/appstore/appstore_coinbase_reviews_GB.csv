2017-11-29 23:16:27,Hi I've bn using Coinbase for about two months now so far so good only downside I have experienced is when the price of the bitcoin drops a chance to buy some and sell at the high rate becomes difficult as it'll occur a error 503 which says too much transactions happening in Coinbase shutting you out of your account till it calms down by then you've lost out abit to make a investment and profit from it or sell abit.

2023-04-14 20:07:57,Since I first started to use Coinbase . I have been stopped from taking advantage of the changing market. Whenever I want to take profit or buy into various coins my account has been blocked or temporarily disabled due to either KYC (which can take months to review) or because there is some problem with security. Security is a problem at Coinbase causing them to block and disable accounts for months at a time. I think they must be getting constant attacks so need to lock down our accounts. During these times you are not allowed access to your funds or to look to see if your BTC or ETH has been taken after they tell you there has been a security failure. The worry is intense because they say nothing and ask you to wait and wait. There is nobody to talk to and they do not accept emails or phone calls. I managed to change my password and verify my identity and address and report my account being temporarily disabled. Now when I need access more than ever before my account is Blocked. Most of the time my account is not accessible. I am having to use credit cards for air flights and holidays. The questions I‚Äôve been required to answer have had me going back to companies I worked for and left over 50 years ago to speak to the HR Departments and ask them for documentation. Every bank statement and letters from my mother. It really is insanity because once I‚Äôm clear they ask for the same things all over again. It‚Äôs a roundabout of questions never ever ending.

Back when i started with coinbase it had Bad customer support no uk tel support emails not getting answered ohh the frustration BUT COINBASE HAS COME A LONG WAY IN THE LAST YEAR 

The dreaded verifying your bank account procedure once you get it done is then a doddle to withdraw.
I am a uk user of coinbase and i can say that yes they will verify your bank account eventually and once they do withdrawing your funds takes the standard bank time of within 2 hrs usually a lot faster..i find that bank deposit to and from my
Coinbase account from my uk bank usually happens within 30 mins..

Coinbase has come so far in the last year with now adding GBP support as well as uk phone support so no more dealing in euros and international payments also they have a uk number for customer support which you can ring any time (take the hint ANY TIME) i called it at about 1 am uk time once and got straight through to a really helpful woman who sorted my problem out...

Patients people coinbase is not a scam and once you get your bank verified then the hard bit is over...
It took me ages tho to verify my account but that was a few years ago when coinbase was not what it is now...coinbase really has come a long way and is currently (at the time of me Writing this) in the process of also enabling you to link a paypal account if you have one so you can deposit and withdraw to your linked paypal from coinbase and buy crypto with your paypal funds if your a user of a certain online auction selling your stuff to make money for me thats a big thumbs up to then buy crypto.

Enjoy peeps do your research and be patient...

Coinbase keeps getting better and I'm excited for what it has in its pipe lines next..

BEWARE though, if a coin or token goes on a massive bull run (goes up a lot in value, very quickly) Coinbase WILL go down and you won‚Äôt be able to get your money or sell your token to get the benefit if it‚Äôs increased value.
This could be an infrastructure problem, to do with massive demand on the site, but experienced crypto hodlers who saw the recent coinbase IPO launch would argue that coinbase must have seen this demand coming, and for a multi billion dollar business, ‚Äòwe couldn‚Äôt cope with the demand‚Äô simply doesn‚Äôt wash.
In short, Coinbase will temporarily steal / freeze all of your money / assets in times of profit unless you know what you are doing.  And good luck trying to contact customer services by the way, coinbase stole ¬£5000 of my money for 6 months before quietly reinstating my account. I sent 15 emails and got absolutely nowhere and almost gave up on that money. Imagine how hopeless things must have seemed to walk away from ¬£5k. The financial regulator wasn‚Äôt interested.  Placing automated trades on the exchange will protect you a bit, but ultimately you never know when you will need to cash out, and you need to know that when you make that decision, you can access your tokens to sell them. In this respect coinbase lets its users down / swindles it‚Äôs less affluent users, so don‚Äôt keep your money on it. Buy your crypto then put it in another wallet, trezor or another offline / paper wallet.

Once sold you have set up an international payment and I‚Äôm still waiting even though I‚Äôve received an email confirming my transfer of the 2 euro to prove the link for international withdrawal was successful. Through moving money about trying to get my cash back into my bank has cost me dearly, every time you do something Coinbase smack a charge on it, not small unnoticeable charges either. I have no doubt when I find out how to get my money out, maybe not through this app and wallet, they will hit me with another charge.
Another one to be aware of, banks charge you as well to set up the international payment.
The app is slow and does not reflect the exact market price 100 percent, when you press sell, by the time you have gone to the next page it will reflect the correct market price and will be potentially less than when you pressed sell, the app also has tendency‚Äôs to freeze when you press sell or not allow your transaction to go through due to errors. This has only happened to me, when prices have risen funnily enough.

I got overexcited and pumped about grand in, saw the numbers grow and was loving it. Yes the ID verification seemed a bit odd but it did work. Adding a credit card to feed the account worked. Adding a bank account (Halifax) to feed the account worked after doing the SEPA transfer (again, felt a bit weird, but worked).

Then I try and make a withdrawal. It doesn‚Äôt work. It seems my Halifax account isn‚Äôt actually validated. Cue me delving into the reviews on here and feeling a sense of dread as I really can‚Äôt afford to lose the grand I‚Äôve put in! I see lots of people in the same situation, saying scam.

Not good. BUT Reddit to the rescue. They put me on to Revolut - an account (with an app) that can deal in Euros. So I figure what have I got to lose? Downloaded it, set it up, did the SEPA to Coinbase (2 to be sure ‚Ç¨2 and ‚Ç¨10) and it worked! Said it was verified in the web version of Coinbase as well. That‚Äôs only half of it though, tried a withdrawal ‚Ç¨10 to test it, 2 days later it‚Äôs in Revolut converted it to GBP, one day later it‚Äôs in my account. That was it, removed the grand, it‚Äôs in my account as of today and the profits are left in Coinbase.

2020-12-21 18:28:49,"I‚Äôm a new Coinbase user and I have recently discovered that there is literally NO customer service for this company. All there seems to be is simply an online report form which you‚Äôre meant to fill out in order to receive a ‚Äúreach out‚Äù by email from some Coinbase representative. 

It‚Äôs been 1 week and so far NOTHING, and I‚Äôm STILL under account restrictions which Coinbase arbitrarily imposed on me without any warning, notice or explanation.

I think I probably tried to convert my cryptos too many times and they just arbitrarily restricted my account from buying or converting cryptos, even though I am a fully verified user. However, it appears that I can still sell and transfer my Coinbase funds to my bank account, which is why I‚Äôm giving this review a two star rating instead of just one. Nonetheless there are plenty reviews about this app by those who claim that they cannot even do this, which is more than a little disconcerting.

Also the transaction fees on Coinbase are completely outrageous bordering on the extortionate. 

At first glance most of Coinbase‚Äôs Apple reviews appear to be good, but just going down the list they all seem to be polar opposites - either very good reviews or very bad, which suggests to me that Coinbase is somehow manipulating its own reviews.

I haven‚Äôt used Kraken yet but I‚Äôve heard very good things about it as far as their customer support is concerned, and I have noticed that Kraken appears to have attempted to address every review that is posted about them.

Called Customer Service to hear they had a 10 hour wait time! 

Called again the following day, hours of wait time but then heard they have a call back facility, so did that and about 8 hrs later I got a call. They just couldn‚Äôt understand the fact that my limit was ¬£0, just kept saying I have all the appropriate features available. They are clearly using a script and try and match your issues with a limited menu, as they settled on the reason for my call was to request an increased limit. However, they cannot do this so will escalate it to a team that will review ‚Äòmy request‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Nothing changed days later. Called again to resolve, exactly the same response! 

It‚Äôs now been well over a week, calls, emails and still they haven‚Äôt made any effort to resolve this for me.

I just can‚Äôt understand why this has either happened or why they just can‚Äôt resolve it for me. 

It‚Äôs a shame as it‚Äôs an easy site to understand and use, but for me - pointless! They‚Äôve lost a new customer as I‚Äôve taken my business to various other exchanges now and have moved all bar 2 of my assets out.

2020-08-27 17:53:19,"It's very easy to exchange your crypto currencies to GBP/USD/EUR but we just trade for their company.
3% hidden fee when you buy/sell/convert 
Think if you start with ¬£100 BTC from your pocket then convert to ETH then sell the buy again then finally sell it and get your money to your pocket 
3% first buy + 3% first convert + 3% first sell + 3% second buy + 3% last sell = 
15% fee and all is hidden. 
5 trade = 15% fee
3%+3%+3%+3%+3%=15% fee

Can you understand how many % chart must move to have some profit ?

It means if you are happy with 5% movement on each trade 
And if all movements were as your expectation and you think ok I'll have 5 times 5% =25% profit, you are absolutely wrong because on each trade you have to pay 3% hidden fee.
So Coinbase will have 15% profit but you will have 10% profit. 
You will have ¬£10 profit and Coinbase will have ¬£15 profit.

This calculation was just if as if you trade true and movements were as your expectation.
But if you trade on bad moments and you loss (for example each trade 5% loss)
After 5 wrong trade 
you will loss : 25%    -¬£25 
Coinbase will profit same all time
3% profit on each trade 
Coinbase profit ¬£10

Imagine in the world Millions of transactions are in progress every day.

Millions 3% profit every day
3% of just 10 millions is ¬£3,000,000 profit every day

2018-02-10 14:22:41,"I opened an account with Coinbase last year and found it very easy to use.
All of my deposits were very quickly received and I was able to purchase bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.
I was happy with the bitcash arrangement and all was good.

However, I decided about a month ago to set up a withdrawal in case I needed to draw off any profits.
However, despite having added my U.K. bank account it didn‚Äôt appear in the withdrawal section.
Coinbase instructions are to deposit a small amount from your U.K. bank account into Coinbase and this creates a link.
It doesnt.
I‚Äôve done it twice now (bank fees ¬£9 each time) and it doesn‚Äôt work.

If you try to contact Coinbase you have to go through the ‚ÄòAdabot‚Äô (which is useless for anything other than very simple problems).
I sent an email to Coinbase 2 weeks ago and still haven‚Äôt heard back.

If you want to turn your money into Crypto‚Äôs then I would recommend Coinbase, but if you want to take it back into national currency at any point in the next two months then don‚Äôt bother.

Up until a month ago I‚Äôd have given this app 4 stars - but now I would say 2 stars is being generous...

Coinbase have replied to my email about the money withdraw matter - after about 6 weeks of waiting - and have FINALLY added my U.K. (Lloyds) bank account.

However I can‚Äôt test whether or not this works as the only way I was able to extract my money was to transfer my entire Coinbase fund out into my own digital wallet (very easy to set up).

The rest of the Coinbase operation (as I have already stated) was excellent - so this incredibly poor bit of their service has completely let them down.",1,False,Chappers73,Coinbase pros and cons,

Coinbase came out and said there was an error. My account is verified at level 2 and I have submitted my ID‚Äôs as I‚Äôve stated  previously my account HAS ALREADY BEEN VERIFIED FOR OVER A YEAR AND MY ACCOUNT HAD BEEN BLOCKED WITH NO EXPLANATION AT ALL!!!!!!!!!

This bull cycle AGAIN my account has been blocked I have been asked AGAIN to verify my account over a week now I am unable to use my account withdraw any of my funds or move my crypto.

A SIMPLE SEARCH ONLINE NOT ONLY SHOWS THAT MULTIPLE OTHER USERS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING SIMILAR THINGS.  What makes this even more disgusting is the fact that Coinbase has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE . You have to fill in a form you cannot speak to anyone directly via email or phone there is virtually NO OTHER FORM OF CONTACT other than the preallocated drop down options on their website . ONCE CONTACTED YOU GET an auto template response (I have verified this)  or they will assure you that the issue is fixed in a given timeframe (24/48h) CLOSE THE SERVICE TICKET WHICH YOU ARE NOW UNABLE TO RESPOND TO. This is disgusting 

I HAVE NOW OPENED 3 tickets for this issue as the first 2 has been closed yet my account is still frozen ‚Äúpending review to be verified‚Äù the last contact I received was 

‚Äú Thank you for following up with us about your account review.

Our team is still working on the review and we don't have any additional updates at this time. We will let you know as soon as we are done with the review and have additional information.‚Äù

please Note the bold text. Now my money is frozen and I am unable to do anything for over a week.

NO ONE SHOULD USE THIS SERVICE
UNLESS YOU ARE OKAY WITH YOUR MONEY BEING FROZEN IN A BULL RUN.

 I WISH I DID A SEARCH ONLINE TO VERIFY BUT SOOOOO MANY OTHER USERS HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH COINBASE,  SOOO MANY.
please do not see this as a personal lash out

2017-09-01 10:47:45,"The app is very buggy and given that these people will be holding money for you it's worth thinking twice whether to use them. As others have mentioned:

1: very difficult to withdraw cash. Even after you go through the convoluted process of setting up a withdrawal account (which takes about 5 days), after a couple of weeks my account was simply deleted for no reason meaning I had to reopen another withdrawal account (again 5 day wait). Note that unless you have a withdrawal amount you cannot (!) get your money out of the platform. This means you may find yourself in a situation where you need to sell urgently, and Coinbase tells you to wait 4-5 days. High risk! 

2: there is no customer service. All get you is an automated bot and an email address which appears completely unmanned. I've sent them a couple of emails, it's been weeks and no one has responded. If something critical were to happen (e.g. a hack) you would be stuck with no help.

3: their currency wallet system is completely faulty. I ve been given a EUR wallet despite being in the Uk. No way of changing  it within the app. You contact them - no response (see point 2). This means every time you transfer money you get hit with exchange rate and foreign transfer fees. 

4: lastly the app is generally quite buggy. Regular crashes and bugs aside, the other day all my accounts reduced to Zero suggesting that my money was gone (!). In these circumstances - as explained - you have no one you can call or contact, you're just stuck not knowing what to do. Luckily in my case the accounts reset to their original values after about 30 minutes - again no idea what caused it and will never know.

All in all - I recommend staying away and finding a different provider. You're dealing with real money here so think twice if you want to take the risk.",1,False,Amanoxc,Beware: lots of issues,

Errors on orders? For example, a little trade <¬£20 showing as ¬£47K+ within the history... That was for a swap and just an example, not actual figures. But very close.

Then I noticed error‚Äôs showing when transferring Ada out to another wallet. Trade value <¬£300 but showed on the account as ¬£394 on the transaction. Can this be looked at? How will this be fair when it comes to my taxes? 

It‚Äôs either something needs fixing regarding the trades on my account and an audit needs to be done/corrections made OR it‚Äôs just because the Coinbase app is not recognising that ADA under GBP, on Coinbase, got turned into USD upon the transfer onto the ADA network? 

That would mean your app is reading actual USD values as GBP, showing incorrect figures.

Your written ‚Äúportfolio balance‚Äù doesn‚Äôt refresh, unless you click on an individual asset, to force an update of that asset, which then forces a portfolio update. 

 The ‚Äúcharts‚Äù fail to accurately report the correct highs / lows of the previous 24hours / week / month etc. This is a major problem that wasn‚Äôt there before the overhaul.

‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù are useless. Other apps let me set EXACT, and multiple, price alerts for any individual asset. (Eg a text alert when Ethereum hits ¬£1351.78976) General ‚Äúthe market is up 5%‚Äù alerts are worthless.

2020-04-15 12:17:18,"-Pros: Trade in ¬£, ‚Ç¨ or $, Correlates market, User friendly, Setup is easy, Easy Payments, Good to Fair security.

-Cons: Fees Extremely High, Price Lags Frequent, Buy Prices Hidden, Lack Of Assets, Old Out of Date News, Bad Custom Price Alerts, Service/Payment Issues, Hidden Fees.

I‚Äôll explain the cons... I‚Äôve been using this app for a month now. Maybe longer but this what I can say so far.

FEES are too high for instance to deposit ¬£80 they‚Äôd charge ¬£2.99 just in fees an asset worth ¬£80 will put you in a loss instantly. Once ready to sell get ready for another ¬£2.99 charge almost guaranteeing you not to make a profit.

PEICE LAGS are an issue on coinbase because the price you see on assets are sell price not buy price. Buy prices are shown only in preview of transaction just before buying it. When markets volatile I am instantly checking the buy prices and it‚Äôs a havoc as I‚Äôd try to buy the asset and the preview will pop up. Keep looking and cancelling until I‚Äôm satisfied to go in at right price. 

LACK OF ASSETS. All trade-able assets add up to about 18 most of them aren‚Äôt good and they have about 2/3 more like DASH, BSV, BTC Gold for some reason I cannot trade in the U.K. Those are Region based.

OLD NEWS. I expect some good up to date news at-least 15-20 articles daily. This helps us predict the market keeping us up to date with crypto‚Äôs without having to download a separate app. As of now there are 8 news articles and the latest one is 8 hours ago honestly. 

PRICES ARE HIDDEN. Assets like Chainlink,  only show a few digits of the actual price. For instance. If it‚Äôs worth 2.856840 to sell coinbase will only show 2.85 or 2.86 and nothing more price so it‚Äôs difficult to get the exact figures and you will need to pretend sell to get the exact amount which is usually lower.

RUBBISH PRICE ALERTS. They have only 3 assets you can set custom price alerts for BTC ETH LTC out of about 18-20. Some of the alerts setup don‚Äôt go off at the right time. 

EARN/LEARN program. I‚Äôve been on the waiting list for their ‚Äúearn while you learn‚Äù program which gives you small crypto‚Äôs for learning about them. Wait can be up-to a year and some people saying they‚Äôre accepted instantly? 

To anyone looking to use the app. Please be careful as it‚Äôs easy to lose out especially if you don‚Äôt look to hold assets for too long and want to move them around. Don‚Äôt panic and Good luck. 

To coinbase. Thanks for the app and platform but please update the app and I will change my review upon improvements. Some of these features will increase the amount of satisfied customers. I.e. Up to date News, Custom Price Alerts For All Assets, Show full Chainlink Prices. Show Together Buy/Sell Rates.

Things to consider are FEES!
