2022-10-05 16:48:46,"I was so impatient to carry out necessary research but I really wanted to jump on the crypto trading and investment buzz.
Unfortunately for me, I invested 90,700 USD
worth of bitcoin with a fraudulent company. I was happy to watch my account grow to 240,575 USD within a couple of weeks. But I didn't realize I was dealing with a scam company, until tried to make an attempt to withdraw. I made a withdrawal request, and noticed my account was suddenly blocked for no apparent reason. I tried contacting customer support, but all to no avail. I needed my money back at all cost, because I could not afford to let it go. So tried all possible means to make sure recovered my scammed bitcoin. I did a lot of online search for help, and tried to see if there were other people who had any similar experience. I stumbled upon a cryptocurrency forum were a couple of people mentioned that they had been through the same process but were able to recover their lost cryptocurrency, funds with the help of Ganesh
Theowletcryptotrade At gmailcom . So I file a report and he was able to help me get back all my lost funds within few hours I feel indebted to him. Apart from trying to express my gratitude to them once again using this medium, I will recommend anybody who wants to recover scammed bitcoin, stolen cryptocurrency, funds lost to binary options forex, investment and any other form of online scam, reach out to Theowletcryptotrade via gmail or telegram",5,1
