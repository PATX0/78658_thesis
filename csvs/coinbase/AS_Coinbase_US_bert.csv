2023-06-14,"I was so impatient to carry out necessary research but I really wanted to jump on the crypto trading and investment buzz. Unfortunately for me, I invested 90,700 USD worth of bitcoin with a fraudulent company. I was happy to watch my account grow to 240,575 USD within a couple of weeks. But I didn‚Äôt realize I was dealing with a scam company, until I tried to make an attempt to withdraw. I made a withdrawal request, and noticed my account was suddenly blocked for no apparent reason. I tried contacting customer support, but all to no avail. I needed my money back at all cost, because I could not afford to let it go. So I tried all possible means to make sure I recovered my scammed bitcoin. I did a lot of online search for help, Iand tried to see if there were other people who had any similar experience. I stumbled upon a cryptocurrency forum were a couple of people mentioned that they had been through the same process but were able to recover their lost cryptocurrency, funds with the help of Ganesh Cyberhackexpert7  At gmailcom . So I file a report and he was able to help me get back all my lost funds within few hours I feel indebted to him. Apart from trying to express my gratitude to them once again using this medium, I will recommend anybody who wants to recover scammed bitcoin, stolen cryptocurrency, funds lost to binary options forex, investment and any other form of online scam , reach out to Cyberhackexpert7 via gmail ‚Ä¶",5,1
2021-08-01,"This app is pretty solid as far as functionality and ease of use, but I do have something I would REALLY like to see changed‚Ä¶ So when a person checks their orders, either the open or filled ones, the small cryptos need to have the decimal extended two more places or so and not rounded to the penny. Some cryptos like DOGE and XLM trade in hundredths of pennies (IE .2577) so it would be nice to see the exact amount listed on the orders. I may have a few orders placed in the .25 range, so it‚Äôs difficult to find a specific order in that range when they all just say .25. I would assume this has to be a pretty easy fix.
I also have another suggestion that would be helpful to me and I‚Äôm sure to others‚Ä¶ It would be a VERY nice feature to be able to set up price alert pushes or at the very least to receive a push notification when one of our orders is filled.
I would definitely give this app 5-stars if the above suggestions were implemented. In fact, I would even pay a subscription fee to be able to have push notifications. I‚Äôm not sure if there is a fee for Coinbase to send out push notifications, but if there is a fee, it can‚Äôt be much as I can get multiple push notifications on the scores of my favorite teams (or even the entire NFL slate of games) from free sports apps.",5,4
2021-08-05,"As I awoke this morning and began my usual routine of inspecting my Coinbase portfolio I happened to stumbled upon a new ‚Äúfeature‚Äù. While curious about prices in the market for today I tapped on the the ‚ÄòTrade‚Äô tab. Following the tapping of this tab I was lead to a new interface. Something I had never seen before. Two new categories: Watchlist and New on Coinbase. The Watchlist category provided, well the assets on your watchlist and the New on Coinbase provided all assets that had been recently added to the platform. Along with these updates came some tweaks to the ‚ÄòGainers‚Äô and ‚ÄòLosers‚Äô categories, which were now in order from Greatest to Least, compared to being all out of order previously. After examining the new Update I delivered a message with screenshots attached to my trading colleague ‚ÄòWallstreetJared‚Äô to alert him of the news. My colleague quickly messaged back ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have yet, sad‚Äù. Following this response I came to the conception that I am a Coinbase beta tester. So here is an immense thank you to the Coinbase family, it‚Äôs been an honor‚Ä¶ really has. The update is 10/10. For ideas on a next update, my colleague and I have been chatting about a potential ‚Äútotal gained‚Äù ‚Äútotal lost‚Äù and ‚Äútotal spent‚Äù addition to the portfolio tab. Thank you again for this opportunity.",5,5
2023-02-28,"For the size of the company, this app and their support is bad. Over the past six month I‚Äôve verified my ID and sent selfies 5 or more times. There‚Äôs no way to speed the transaction when they feel to slow you down or flag an $80 transaction! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Spent an hour with support thinking perhaps there‚Äôs a secondary layer 2FA one can add to the account to avoid needing to send my ID and face. Not happy with all this photo collecting biometric nonsense especially as you can bet your last dollar these companies share that data with hundreds of other companies over time just like your email address. Make no mistake there‚Äôs a reason you get junk and unwanted mail form all over the place yet you signed up for one only. Slow, support is mehhh, instructions are incorrect. After sending transaction it sent me. Text message where I can email üòÇ I sent the email and got an instant reply that that no longer works and to rather visit their help enter. Again for the size they‚Äôre you‚Äôd assume they have their automated texts emails in better order and have a better more reliable way to confirm a transaction than needing to send selfies and ID for an aged account that‚Äôs been verified 5years ago. I don‚Äôt recommend anyone storing large sums on the app. Also in case you try buy something for crypto make sure you have other payment options available bc you might have to wait a few hours for the transaction to clear or worse wait 3-5business days. Good luck",2,1
2022-05-05,"When searching for the best cryptocurrency wallet to keep your cryptocurrencies, one very important thing that comes to the mind is reliability and flexibility of the app due to variety of options that could be explored in cryptocurrency trading and investment. One core value is the assurance that your cryptocurrency is safe as market prices fluctuates. I‚Äôve made use of some crypto apps in the past that‚Äôs not as flexible and reliable just as I need it, but I‚Äôve been able to enjoy the features of this app. Ordinarily, I get conscious of using wallets or apps I‚Äôll get to deposit money from my bank account ever since my wallet with over $250k was hijacked and all my coins got lost. My profound gratitude forever goes to Bestcyberspy atgmailcom,that successfully recovered my coins for me immediately I came across their contact and hired these experts. I felt so delighted. Little did I know this recovery professionals and tech experts have helped several Europeans recovered their lost bitcoins and still working effectively until I got their astonishing service through their contact/support team mail Bestcyberspy atgmailcom You can also contact them for any crypto issues tech support such as lost bitcoins recovery or any other crypto recovery and thank me later for this review.",5,5
2021-06-10,"I‚Äôve had my account for years, my bank account verified for years too. I‚Äôve been trying for weeks to withdraw cash from account. I enter the transfer, it all seems fine, I get an email that withdrawal is underway and should arrive at bank in 3 or 4 days. A day or two after expected date the money still fails to arrive and an email comes - ‚Äúyour transaction has been cancelled, please try again‚Äù. No explanation, no help to correct whatever the problem was (if there even was one). It‚Äôs like a Hotel California app... your money can check out anytime you like... BUT IT CAN NEVER LEAVE.

Update: it took a few days but I did get a response. My withdrawals were cancelled because the names on my accounts did not match. Specifically, my checking account, opened 20+ years ago, uses my middle initial and my Coinbase account uses my full middle name (as they used my driver‚Äôs license which has my full name on it). They said ‚Äúadd a new account to transfer funds to that has a matching name‚Äù. Turns out I already had that, my PayPal account, which also used my driver‚Äôs license to verify my name and comply with Know Your Customer laws. I transferred to PayPal and it went through almost immediately üëç",5,1
2021-10-11,I am impressed by how easy this app is to use.  There is endless amounts of information about cryptocurrency on Coinbase and if it is t there u can be connected to it.  I had been weary about crypto but when I heard about Coinbase I was originally in getting shares of it when it went public.  When I was unable to get the stock and it went through the roof right off like had figured we‚Äôll that is when I decided to download and check it out.  Coinbase gave me a small amount for down loading the app and then through the learn and earn feature I was able to learn what crypto is and does but also get like four different currencies.  The ease of operation of the app made it very i intimidating and I continued to learn about crypto amd now I‚Äôm trading almost daily.  I also had some support issues with my Coinbase card and they were quickly replied to and I was given some basic help which was unable to solve the problem but they sent my issue up the support chain and my Coinbase card was fully operational the next morning.  I say thank you to Coinbase for making it easy for me to learn and operate trading with crypto currency‚Äôs because it has been easy making money.,5,5
2022-08-12,"On November 25th I tried to transfer my btc to another wallet and I was told the transaction would be on hold due to security reasons and I had to upload my ID. It wouldn‚Äôt let me so I let it go and waited the 3 days it said it would take. Well flash forward 5 days, I had completely forgotten about it and hurried to check both accounts and my email since I know I never received it. Somehow the account I had tried to transfer it to said I received the btc on November 23rd which would‚Äôve been impossible. I tried to contact support for both accounts and got a couple of unhelpful, ‚Äúit was deposited,‚Äù replies. Flash forward again to tax season and I had my tax documents from both account that say the $500 was deposited on the 23rd but Coinbase transferred it on the 26th. I showed them that and showed the other account I haven‚Äôt even been able to spend $500 to reach the $0 I was at so the math doesn‚Äôt add up either but not even an apology was given from either companies. I saw someone else review Coinbase with the same exact issue a few days after me so I‚Äôm sure Coinbase knows their system messed up in November but don‚Äôt care. I had put $500 in Coinbase for emergencies and I was kicked out of my apartment after a medical emergency so I was in an double emergency and Coinbase made it a triple emergency and cost me a roof over my head for the mistakes they don‚Äôt seem to acknowledge. I don‚Äôt even know how many emergencies that all comes out to now.",1,1
2022-01-31,"I‚Äôve had this app for a while now to do simple investing. Recently, I decided to get into NFTs and wanted to transfer crypto into its compatible wallet. When doing so, I was sent an email saying that I needed to verify my ID, and if I didn‚Äôt, there would be a 72 hour delay. I verified my ID and received a message saying that verification was successful. After 20-30 minutes of waiting for my wallet to populate with my crypto, the balance still said $0. I sent it to the correct wallet address before anyone asks. I reached out to their support team just to be have the conversation end abruptly by the agent. So the next morning, I message again to ask where it is. This was a Saturday. He then told me that it will be in my wallet on Sunday. Sunday rolls around, and it‚Äôs not there. I contact them AGAIN and the agent tells me she sees it‚Äôs being worked on and there‚Äôs a 72 hour delay. I explained i did the ID verification successfully and there shouldn‚Äôt be a delay. She said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the protocol‚Äù and ended the conversation thread!!! I contact them TODAY (Monday) and they can‚Äôt give me any answers or a timeline. I needed the crypto today for a mint on an NFT and now I‚Äôve missed out on several thousand dollars because of this poor way of Coinbase doing things. This is unacceptable especially when people are trying to make money through your platform!!! There are other platforms out there so it would be beneficial if you search elsewhere.",1,1
2022-01-04,"So this is my first app that I used for investing, had my hopes up but the customer service really brought down my motivation for using this app. Honestly i regret downloading it. Once I had downloaded the app I went through the whole process to be able to start buying and selling but once I tried buying through my chase account that I had already linked and yes I did everything exactly how the app demanded it, but it still wouldn‚Äôt let me buy because of suspicious activity. So I contact their help support, after telling the bot to put me in contact with a person since the bot was not being helpful at all. Turns out theirs nobody you can call it‚Äôs all through text and once I explain my problem he would just tell me to put my id and a pic which I already had done so I re-did the process and still nothing change I kept telling him that but he would keep sending me the same message about putting my id and pic it almost seem like he was just sending me texts he had save in his system. So once he finally realize that his way wasn‚Äôt working he send my problem to be check by someone else where I got an email saying that they where checking my account and around six days they would get back to me I open up my email today and I see an email from them saying that they close my case without even fixing nothing. I have to give it to them they really know how to frustrate someone",1,2
2021-05-19,"The app is OK! You cannot add price alerts except for a couple of coins, so I have another platform that I am using for that purpose, along with much better charting graphs, profits/losses, average coin price and everything else you watch when investing, because coinbase doesn‚Äôt have any of these common investing tools. I‚Äôm in the process of switching to the another platform since Coinbase fees are through the roof, and I feel like they have their hands in every single thing I do; I‚Äôm almost afraid to even open the app in fear they may tack on nother fee. The costs are not small either; buying a small number of coins that are well under a dollar without staking options, the fee‚Äôs are more than quadruple the cost of the coin, then another fee when you sell any portion of it. So, watch carefully you could be in the hole with their fees added on. They do have a lot of coins to choose from but so do other platforms and with other platforms, you have MUCH lower fees, better graphing charts, profit/loss, price alerts, buy/sell options and many more investment tools. I have no problem paying a fee for doing business, however, I do have a problem when I feel like I‚Äôm being robbed! Coinbase doesn‚Äôt do ANYTHING special to deserve taking that amount of money they take from us, in fact they do a lot less than their competitors!",2,3
2023-02-09,"I had Coinbase loaded onto my phone since early 2020. As of last week, they updated it and it requires an iOS of 14.0. I have gotten the most recent update of my iOS to 12.5.7, so the app will not work on my phone. I thought, OK, I‚Äôll just go to the website. Nope. Cannot sign on there. There‚Äôs no place to sign in on the website. I tried sending an email by clicking the ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù link. It doesn‚Äôt work. None of the options work. I did a Google search for a Coinbase email address for support, and found a couple. One worked but said they no longer responded to emails, and directed me to click a link. That link took me back to the same previous ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù page where nothing works. There is no way to contact them about not being able to access the app or site. Pitiful customer service.

 I‚Äôm glad I never invested with Coinbase. The cryptocurrencies I received there were earned by doing the tasks required to get free crypto. I was testing it out to see how it would go. My crypto grew slowly to nearly $60, but then the bottom dropped out of sight. The last time I was able to check, my crypto was only worth about $8, where it had been hovering for a while. The $5 in Bitcoin I‚Äôd received was only worth about $1.50. I wouldn‚Äôt trust cryptocurrencies, not any more than I trust Coinbase... which is not at all. It won‚Äôt let me put in a ‚ÄúZERO‚Äù choice of stars, so one it is.",1,1
2023-05-04,"I opened my account with Coinbase in January 2021. Since then, and me hardly trading or moving my money out (long term hold, right?); when FTX collapsed, many of my friends were panicking, pulling money out, etc. I honestly didn‚Äôt think twice about dropping Coinbase!  I even use their Wallet App to hold and/or Stake assets. 
My research of Coinbase, again after FTX, showed I don‚Äôt have ‚Äúa lot‚Äù to worry about. 
Their stock sure took a beating since the early days and the highs (I was purely lucky when I sold at 300s). However, balance sheet, financial statements , assets and Most Important - their ‚ÄúCoin‚Äù - the USDC, is (again) Stable and supported just enough for my comfort. 
Today, I needed to liquidate some of my assets, for a major transaction, and the App, UI, Flow, Options, Large Offering and speed of both, transfers, sales and sending money out to banks and financial institutions; I am very pleased and continue to have, again, ‚ÄúJust Enough‚Äù confidence in Coinbase as a company that I will continue to be a client and even probably, recommend it to friends, family and anyone who reads this review ‚Äî With the Disclaimer ‚Äî Do your own homework.",5,5
2022-03-28,"Ive been introduced to coinbase by a scam who claimed to be from coinbase wallet wanting to invite people in liquidity mining to gain it‚Äôs user base, like a promotion. I trusted it because it was an app launched from coinbase wallet. My understanding is it is my account and I hv full control of it, just like I have full control of my bank account, and all the apps launched from my bank account should be legible. That‚Äôs how I got tricked. The fact is, once I launch the app from coinbase wallet, I‚Äôve signed ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù which allows third party to withdraw from my coinbase wallet indefinitely. At first I thought coinbase is definitely responsible for allowing the scammer app to launch from their app, but it turns out that they deny the liability claiming in crypto world it is always ‚Äúur decision to make‚Äù, that freaked me out because it can legally allow anyone to take users money away without putting on any warning, which is even worse than real world. How can online bank account launch third party app without warning people it is possibly a scam and it has nothing to do with the bank, it is not hard to do so in coinbase and they refuse to put that warning, causing lots of ppl losing money from scam. I have full proof that the scammer claimed to be from coinbase and it is app launched from coinbase which made it more believable. Why can‚Äôt coinbase put on warning? Btw I lost 100k thx to coinbase!",1,1
2022-05-26,"Coinbase requires a valid government issued ID to send & receive anything. In states with ‚ÄúTrue ID‚Äù you don‚Äôt get a physical ID card the day of the transaction. It is mailed & doesn‚Äôt come until 10-15 days after getting your photo taken. Once that‚Äôs done the license authorizing place will issue a temporary license on paper. Coinbase will not accept this as a valid license. They require a physical plastic card license. Coinbase will allow you to deposit money but won‚Äôt allow you to send or receive anything until you have acquired your physical license. So, if you‚Äôve already put money into your coinbase account at this point it‚Äôs now locked up and can‚Äôt be transferred until the physical plastic ID card has arrived. The only option you have is to withdraw back to the original bank account you sent it from. On top of that, if you attached a bank account and didn‚Äôt use wire transfer, your transferred funds are now on hold for approximately 5-7 business days. There is no warning or requirements that alert the user to need to complete their ID verification before transferring money into the coinbase account & that you will not be able to send or receive funds. Also, if you use an attached bank account that you transferred funds from into your coinbase, that money is subject to a hold time of appropriately 5-7 business days. This company has been one big headache",1,1
2022-04-18,"Coinbase seems to be the dominant crypto trading platform in the US, but this app is not by any chance close to a professional trading app! I read a ""Thank You"" review by another user because he had noticed the addition of ""Watchlist"" and ""New Coins"" to the app!! This is as childish as it can imaginably be! Are you guys at kindergarten or what?! Any trader, not the professional stock market traders, but even an average joe will realize how primitive coinbase app is! Cryptos are being traded 24/7 and we definitely need candle stick charts with technical indicators. What do we get with this app? A childish graph with absolutely NO indicators, NO candles, NO settings, basically NOTHING! The graphs are absolutely useless. I wonder if coinbase users trade by tossing coins or what?!! There are absolutely no helpful market tools such as filters, simple scanners, or any activity monitoring tools either. The watchlist is so primitive and lacks even the most basic functionality such as sorting. Any time I open this app I start hating to trade on this platform! Is there anyone at coinbase who has ever traded stocks?! I'm sure there is, and they know exactly how low profile this app is! But they have no serious will to upgrade it to something better probably because they feel they are not rivaled by any competitor! So, they keep their high commission fees and they do nothing to improve! What a shame!",1,1
2021-10-28,"So this app is great for trading/purchasing crypto.  I‚Äôve used it for nearly a year with no issues.  Now that this is out of the way:

The number of times that changes have occurred to the interface, then changed back, then changed to the prior version, then another‚Ä¶it‚Äôs maddening.  Here are my priorities: 1. See my portfolio balance and trajectory over (x) period. 2. See the coins I have and how they have faired over (x) period.  3. See what are the top movers over (x) period.  4. Trade one coin for another. 
When I can no longer do one of the above because of a UI change that adds functionality that is not one of my priorities, it is frustrating.  When I have no method of customizing the UI for my priorities to get it back, it‚Äôs frustrating.  When one of the missing priorities returns and then is removed or changed in a way that feels as if it were removed‚Ä¶it is frustrating.  
I‚Äôd rather not be frustrated, so please don‚Äôt remove features, if you must put something else in the UI, provide me with means to discover where the feature I care for is now located.  This will allow you to continue to experiment with new features while allowing me to continue to achieve my goals.",3,3
2022-02-26,"Your customer service it‚Äôs terrible. The people have no solutions for any of your problems, basically they just tell you to wait and hopefully it will fix itself. I transferred $400 from my bank account to my coin base account, And he says I‚Äôm ready for trading, I made a $100 tradeOne day and then when I tried to trade the other $300 the next day Coinbase said that I could not make the transaction because I was on able to get the money from my bank account which was just sitting there for the taking and it cost me a week and a half of training and I missed the drop on ETH. The coin base app told me to make a payment to correct the problem but the app kept saying it was having connection problems, and then two days later CoinbaseEmailed me a message, telling me they what‚Äôs going to take $400 From my crypto. So I called customer service and they have no clue on what to do. My wife had to do it from her phone to make the payment it went through, but I took another week before my account was in good standings, and by that time the market shot back up meaning I lost money for nothing.",5,1
2023-04-12,"Most importantly, I do not want anyone to have funds made unavailable and avoid painful situations. Always do a test send to and from Coinbase in small amounts this will ensure there are no net work issues or software bugs, resulting in potential loss of funds. Even if you have used that methods before it may change by the day or software update. Saved addresses will display the correct hash but may not always accurately apply saved memos. Unacceptable delays in send/receive timeframes exceed standards (coinbase claims to use a third party hot wallet service that is inefficient, slow, and potentially not liable for coinbase software/tech issues).

It‚Äôs unfortunate that coinbase is outperformed, overshadowed, and obsolete compared to almost every other exchange. It may be age of the company or the challenges to operate on the US, but as soon as the regulatory hurdles are cleared coinbase will be left in the dust if they don‚Äôt revamp the platform. A simple action such as sending XLM has become an overwhelming liability. I have had more money than I care to admit held hostage by coinbase due to technical issues when in fact it was all caused by the inadequate software used by CB and incompetent engineers. I am surprised that there have not been more complaints or worse from dissatisfied customers. If there were Breyer on ramp options in the US I would gladly forget this company and app.",1,1
2022-12-07,"Update: the developer fixed the issue I had with logging in. The aspect ratio is somewhat improved but not great. The main issue I‚Äôm noticing now is that on the home tab, I‚Äôm unable to scroll or otherwise interact in any way with the screen. Everything seems to work fine in the other tabs. I‚Äôve updated my rating from one star to 3 and will raise it to 5 once the remaining bugs are fixed. I appreciate the quick response, hopefully these bugs will also be resolved soon.

Old review: The other day, I got a notification that my portfolio had been migrated from Coinbase pro to Coinbase. I‚Äôm not sure why the developers decided to do this, Coinbase pro worked well enough but it wouldn‚Äôt have been been an issue if the Coinbase app worked on my iPad Pro. Why I opened the app, the screen was obviously designed for a phone, not a tablet. I had the same issue with pro but at least pro was still useable. With the Coinbase app, when I went to enter my email, the keyboard wouldn‚Äôt let me type in numbers. I have a lot of assets tied up in Coinbase, not being able to access it is a major problem.

2022-01-20,"Welcome to the new consumer savings account. As a consumer alone in the crypto jungle i am sometimes saddened by the limits of coin base yet the security and trust in whats offered upon the simple coinbase acct.  is reasonable i believe.  The house always wins and i guess it should if it upholds a service and commitment to said service. Accepting i am not a trader on the coinbase platform knowing this and accepting that i must HODL as a savings acct. is one of the greatest experiences i have had personally on my device. 
   A greater level of customer engagement would be a great value increase for the reputation of the app.  Log in issues and quirks can not be related our consulted upon in any real way so beyond standard FAQ‚Äôs i have been left alone to understand certain quirks. It may be different on the fancier wallet or counbase pro i would not know cause i am not a trader i am merely a crypto addict who cant get enough btc! And squirrels away any pocket change i can !

2021-08-14,As an ole man who was investing first time in a decentralized currency who is ill-informed having limited knowledge of this specific subject matter began to observe - the  influence with this specific currency as a hedge against inflation in a addition to potentially replacing  gold as the preferred asset of choice globally- that aside I wanted - frankly needed or more importantly required a platform which was secure - easily navigation able- provided news and was regulated- Coinbase fit the bill- it provided a platform for a Baby- Boomer to comfortably invest for me and my family- i would like to see the transaction fees come down just a little as well as some additional tutorials -  other than these insignificant matters- I‚Äôm happy for the choice- one recommendation is to apply some of your $$$ to branding & marketing- the landscape out there is not only messy it is treacherous- I‚Äôm certain there are large portion of middle aged men such as I - that would utilize your platform to the exclusion of lesser known platforms if you would alleviate the fear quotient and distinguish Coinbase from its competitors,5,4
2021-01-16,"There are many things I like about Coinbase. Easy and intuitive interface, easy of trading between currencies, etc. But as I got more savvy in my trading and started tracking gains, I‚Äôve found discrepancies between increases in currency rates and my balance. In other words, I would track the time in which I had made trades and calculate the amount that my balance should reflect. I found almost always that it was off and not by a little, by a lot. This is alarming to me as I see that there is real potential for fraud within this platform. In addition, I‚Äôd sent a transfer of funds from MY Binance account to my Coinbase account and after a week, I have yet to see those funds deposit to my ETC wallet that I‚Äôd used for the transfer. I‚Äôve sent multiple customer service requests since then regarding the transfer both to Binance and to Coinbase. Binance has gotten back to me sharing the blockchain record of my transfer to my ETC Coinbase account indicating that I would need to remedy account receipts with Coinbase. I reached out to Coinbase and then have yet to respond. This was not a small amount. It is not okay for them to have inaccurate gains reflecting in account balances and no response on transactions that should have cleared over a week ago now. 

I will be filing a complaint with SEC outlining these discrepancies and their failure to remedy them.",1,2
2022-04-04,"They 100% screw you over with fees. It costs 1.99$ to buy any type of cryptocurrency. If you want to trade one currency to another it costs $.99, and if you want to transfer it back to your bank account it costs another $1.99. So I have to pick the right currency, make sure it goes up at least $3.99 up in profit just to make any money? Which is very unlikely, because apps like these are designed to screw over the little people that want get into buying and selling crypto. I understand that the company has to make money some how, but charging every single transaction a bunch of money isn‚Äôt even fair. I was offered in app $1 in a crypto currency. Want to know how much it cost me to transfer it to any type of coin that made money? $.99. They offer you free crypto that is stagnant in price, to make you pay money to transfer it to other cyrptos. It‚Äôs so rigged. Do yourself a favor, and save your money instead of investing in this app. You‚Äôre basically throwing your money away if you buy anything on here.

Update: Tried cashing out because my stocks I invested in were up big time, app wouldn‚Äôt let me. Kept saying servers were down. And then because I was up so much (like $10 more) it charged me additional fees so I only ended up making $1. Are you serious Coinbase?! You have serious issues with fees. Stop charging so much.",1,1
2022-09-03,"I love the app, it‚Äôs a bit slow for whatever reason even on the IPhone 11 Pro Max. However my main concern are the notifications and transaction fees for coinbase. I‚Äôve always been stuck using 3rd party alerts for my coins as well as 3rd party decentralized platforms that have .10c fees per every transaction meanwhile I lose $3-$5 per transaction even for converting one to another. Throughout the many years of using coinbase the notifications have never worked accordingly or at all, I‚Äôm not just talking about the actual notifications but when you receive movement notifications they‚Äôre extremely behind. I won‚Äôt receive important alerts or notifications but then sometimes it will send me a notification every other hour, especially when there‚Äôs a lot of movement in the market. Just seems a little odd and slow for such a large company. coinbase vs literally what I use everyday will always be the last app to notify me accordingly of anything important.

2022-01-17,"I‚Äôve been using and a fan of Coinbase for a long time but as of late it‚Äôs just really hard for me to recommend. You don‚Äôt actually technically speaking ‚Äúown‚Äù any of your crypto, but that‚Äôs not my main issue. Lately I‚Äôve put a lot and I mean A LOT of money into buying this most recent dip, had no problems until I decided to log on and found I wasn‚Äôt able to send any of my crypto. Over the next week, I lost the ability to cash out, sell do anything. Not a problem? I logged in, I have been asked to verify my identity 3 times and even then still my situation hasn‚Äôt improved. I later found a notification in my account that I owed them like $100? Weird but okay fine, I paid it. It took over a week for that to finally be cleared from my account but it took the money from my bank so I figured all was good, went back on and was asked to verify my identity AGAIN. Limits hadn‚Äôt been removed, still couldn‚Äôt send or anything. It‚Äôs impossible to get ahold of support, even with the live chat youre sat waiting there for 45 minutes for them to type a response and when they do it‚Äôs the same copy paste crap, customer support is completely unresponsive and impossible to get a hold of. So now I‚Äôm left with $1000 sitting in an account that I can do nothing on, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.",1,2
2022-03-19,"I have been buying LRC on Coinbase for a couple months now, and I can‚Äôt believe it took me so long to notice, but they run the same scam that Robinhood runs with their crypto, except RH doesn‚Äôt charge a Transaction fee each time. Pay attention when you go to a coin. They show you the list price, but when you review your purchase before submitting it, they actually charge you a higher price/coin on top of their transaction fee. It‚Äôs the same thing with selling. They give you a lower rate than the listed price, as well as charging you transaction fees. They‚Äôre scalping customers, exactly the same way RH does by giving you, ‚Äúthe customer‚Äù a .03 cent spread. Even with the ‚ÄúCoinbase One‚Äù membership, this is still true.

If you can learn more complicated methods of trading crypto, I suggest that over this. If not, I hope you don‚Äôt mind getting scalped. The GOOD thing about Coinbase is that you can actually transfer your coins to different wallets, which shows they do actually have coins to give you should you actually request them sent to your wallet.

Response to Developers Response: This isn‚Äôt 2020. With everything that happened in 2021, investors are becoming wiser to things like Spread, PFOF, and the conflicts of interest in brokers and Wall St. in general.",2,1
2021-11-10,"The latest update to the Coinbase app has decreased functionality. Users like me want a snapshot of all their crypto investments on the homepage. This means to see their overall portfolio balance as well as all the coins on their watchlist. A quick overview with no further clicks. This is how it used to be. Now, in the latest version, the watchlist is limited to 5 items. If you want to see the rest of your items, you have to click into another screen. Horrible UI. It may seem small, but I check my investments multiple times per day. It used to be one simple click to open Coinbase, see my favorite coins, and done. Now every single time I open the app I have to click into multiple screens to see everything I want to see. Very annoying! Please fix this ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù and bring back the old homepage with full watchlist functionality. Or better yet, let users create multiple watchlists like Robinhood where you can organize them better and maybe we can choose if we want them on the homepage or not. Removing a feature that your users have had for years is not a smart business decision. Robinhood shows all investments on the homepage and that‚Äôs why everyone always compliments their UI. I hope Coinbase can bring back what was the equivalent in the crypto world.",1,1
2023-03-17,"Updating from two to one star for the canned response they left on this review, which indicates they didn‚Äôt read it. Of course the funds aren‚Äôt available right away, but they shouldn‚Äôt continue to be held after the transaction clears with my bank. 7 full days is so arbitrarily long.

Original review:

Even after a transaction to buy crypto clears with your bank, they call it ‚Äúpending‚Äù so they can hold it for the full 7 days. Any time a bank doesn‚Äôt let you access your own funds, it‚Äôs either security or it‚Äôs because they want to make money off your money. The longer it‚Äôs with them, the more they can make. Then, when you do want to move some money, they charge you super high fees to do it. Crypto is such a friggin‚Äô scam. Not as bad as NFT‚Äôs, but still ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs going to be a long time before crypto is actually worth it to most people, which is why it‚Äôs also so volatile and even a huge group of celebrities and investors can get scammed out of millions, like with FTX. Coinbase is just another company making money hand over fist without providing good support to customers or offering decent fees. They‚Äôre not FTX, but they‚Äôre profiting majorly off an unstable system without providing good support along the way, and charging an arm and a leg for their good enough services.",1,2
2022-04-18,"DO NOT USE COINBASE! Coinbase is basically a company of scammers that have come together to steal crypto from their customers. Look at all the real peoples reviews with reports of missing crypto and poor support. Their support is garbage their technicians don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about and refuse to help for simple things even when it‚Äôs clearly stated in Coinbases own policy. When you send facts and evidence they stop replying. Even the $5 free bitcoin promotion that is still shown here you won‚Äôt get it and they won‚Äôt help you or care after you make an account. If you decide to use Coinbase expect nothing but headaches transfers will go missing, any promotional bonuses or offers are fake you won‚Äôt really get them, if you contact support they will send you links to their support page that show what you contacted for and need help with is within their policy but then they just stop replying or make up bogus reasons of why they can‚Äôt help. It‚Äôs amazing this company is still able to operate when they break so many basic laws about false advertising and consistently screw over their customers. I pray Coinbase gets shut down or at least heavily audited everything will quickly fall if they‚Äôre forced to take responsibility for their claims, actions, and publicity published policies.",1,1
2021-03-30,"I hate giving this rating given the fact that Coinbase has been my go to wallet but as of the last couple months it‚Äôs been absolutely HORRIBLE. When I ask to raise my limits from 50 dollar card purchases it somehow instead of being increased got lowered to $5.00. I emailed support over a month ago and they gave me a generic response saying that it was being sent up to review and would have someone email me back. This was a month ago and I am still waiting on that email. So ok that‚Äôs just a slight inconvenience because I can always just make a purchase with my bank account. WRONG every attempt made gets turned down due to ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù which only gets worse because of the fact that this happened on not 1 but all 3 of my bank accounts connected. So once again I have to contact support. This time I try to call to actually speak to someone since they are unwilling to respond to support via email. What do you know, I run into another issue. Coinbase no longer has telephone support anymore. That‚Äôs only reserved for compromised accounts. So that‚Äôs great I have to email yet again... Here we are now and since I have been waiting to make this purchase BTC has only risen by about 15-20k or more. So thank you Coinbase for being absolutely worthless as of late.",1,1
2021-05-28,"I have been a member of coin base for a little over a year I am very happy with the way transactions take place immediately. I have however been having a few issues with the site some of the issues are you are unable to purchase certain cryptocurrency‚Äòs I‚Äôm not sure why this is but it is very frustrating when you want to buy something and you can‚Äôt. I also purchased an asset I was told that it would be untradable after January 20, 2021 but if I had any of the asset remaining in your portfolio you would still be able to sell it , this is not the case. I‚Äôve tried several times to rectify the situation but I‚Äôve been unsuccessful. Sadly the only way to communicate with coin base is through text so it is very difficult to get your point across or for them to discuss something with you , it would be much better and a big improvement if you could communicate with an individual so you can express yourself and get situations handled much easier. I hope this helps anyone that‚Äôs considering to join the site and like I said before the majority of things on the site work great enjoy have fun don‚Äôt invest more then you can lose.",3,4

There was a link to verify my 5 year old account. If I completed this process, the wait would be cancelled. It required me to submit photos of both sides of my Drivers License and a selfie. Well, after several attempts, it didn‚Äôt like my selfie and said I needed to wait 24 hours before I could try again. This time it seemed to like it and said my account was ‚ÄúVERIFIED ‚Äú No transfer took place! When November 27th, 3:00 pm pacific time arrived ( yesterday ) no transaction took place. My account balance is $1600 less than it was and I have had no other communication from them.

2018-08-17,"All very fast and professional, right up until you try to cut your losses. Bought bitcoin with the intention of selling it a few days later for a (tiny) profit as more of an experiment than anything. I sent in my license photos, linked my bank account, and got everything verified. Bought a couple hundred in btc. A few days later the price has gone up a few hundred and I try to sell- to find my funds placed on a ‚Äò24 day hold‚Äô to ‚Äòprevent fraud‚Äô. What?? If this is common practice, they certainly went out of their way not to mention it, and if it isn‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt think of any reason why they would have flagged me or my transaction as suspicious. I have now sat and watched the btc price plummet over $1,000 in the past few weeks. By the time I‚Äôm able to access my money I will have lost much of it. I understand that btc prices are famously erratic and I accept that I would have lost a little bit, but with every day I lose more and more of MY money which is being held from me. Incredibly disappointed with the lack of clarity in this matter. If it were not for this ridiculous, month-long freeze on my transaction, I would be very happy with this app. The layout is nice and the verification was fast and professional.

2020-10-31,"There is absolutely zero customer support with coinbase. I‚Äôve been trying for 2 days to reach an actual human about why my money is being held captive.

So after 2 days of trying to figure out why that is, I finally just gave up and sold the btc expecting to be able to withdraw my remaining cash balance. And I lost $10 in this process, over coinbase fees, and I didn‚Äôt even care. I just wanted my money back. But now there is a hold on my cash balance too! And I needed that money yesterday. I can‚Äôt afford to wait 5 days. But coinbase doesn‚Äôt care in the slightest. Because there is no way to reach anybody for customer support. You can email them, but you will just get a robotic response saying it will take 5-7+ days to fix your issue. So I‚Äôm pretty positive that nobody even actually reads the customer support emails. And now my only money is being held captive by this website that won‚Äôt even give me the time of day to tell me why. I‚Äôm extremely frustrated. This app is the worst btc app I‚Äôve ever used, because this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve had issues like this where ‚Äúcustomer support‚Äù did absolutely nothing for me.

2020-10-20,I‚Äôve been dealing with Coinbase Support for 6 weeks now and my issue still has not been resolved. You can only contact via email which takes days for them to reply and most times its a automated response. Once you actually get a real response its often vague and instructions that are already listed on their website. If you‚Äôre having issues with staking certain crypto currencies then good luck on getting them fixed because I am still unable to stake. They claim my account is unverified but yet I have went through the verification process numerous times and even have level 3 (highest level) verification on my account. I have tried contacting on social media and have gotten nowhere. I have tried callihg but can‚Äôt even get to speak to a person because they only will deal with account compromises over the phone which is a total load of crap. I would not recommend coinbase solely because their support services are atrocious. you are likely to have an issue when encountering this platform and will need their help at some point. I have friends who have had similar experiences in the past with different issues and experienced the same level of aggravation for coinbase support.,1,1
2019-08-17,"I‚Äôve tried Robinhood, Abra and Coinbase for Crypto buying. Simply put Coinbase has a good set up but they nickel and dime you to death. For example; to deposit money even with bank transfer you are charged a fee of 0.99 for up to $25, $1.49 for up to $50, $1.99 for up to &100 and so on. Robinhood and Abra does not charge you for bank transfers, only card deposits. Coinbase also charges you again to sell your crypto‚Äôs at basically the same fees as depositing. Robinhood and Abra do not. Coinbase basically hits your wallet all over when that‚Äôs money that could be invest in crypto‚Äôs. Now let‚Äôs get onto the refer a friend side of it. Coinbase will give you $10 worth of crypto after someone you invite joins and buys $100 worth of crypto. Abra gives you and friend joining each $25 worth of Bitcoin after friend deposits a minimum of $50. Robinhood gives you a free stock each. Overall Abra is by far the best Cryptocurrency app for buying and selling. Robinhood is okay for beginners but you can‚Äôt send crypto‚Äôs. Robinhood is good for buying and selling like you do stocks, also Robinhood let‚Äôs you buy stocks so you can use one app to be in two different markets at once (stocks and crypto‚Äôs). What I‚Äôm saying is do not waste your time and money on Coinbase. Abra is hands down better with hardly having any fees across the entire board.",1,1
2022-04-26,"I‚Äôve been using Coinbase for several years and though it wasn‚Äôt perfect the app filled most of my needs. I didn‚Äôt even mind that they charge higher than average fees.
I recently took a couple months off trading but woke up one morning to a call from my bank that Coinbase was attempting to withdraw $5,000 from my account. An action I certainly did not initiate as I was well aware I had less than $10 in the bank.
I contacted Coinbase immediately and notified them that my account had been hacked. Yet somehow they had instantly credited my crypto account for the $5,000 and then allowed it to be sent somewhere. Now I have never been able to send or withdraw funds until they cleared the bank but I guess the hacker just had the special touch.
Two months went by and I still hadn‚Äôt heard from Coinbase, so I reached out to them again. At which time they inform me that my account is locked until I pay for the missing funds! Their reasoning is that I somehow allowed my account to be hacked. Well the way I see it the most logical explanation given the turn of events is that it was hacked from within Coinbase itself. Anyhow they can keep the account locked because they won‚Äôt be seeing me or getting my business again.",1,1

Mind you I didn‚Äôt know it was a glitch so I was extremely happy that this coin made me some money. Then the nightmare began.

2021-10-27,"Coinbase is a fee-based software that allows regular individuals to invest their hard-earned cash in cryptocurrency. Coinbase, unlike other apps, charges a high fee for clients to store and secure funds in Coinbase crypto wallets. You'll also pay a market buy/sell price that's substantially more than the actual price of the coin you're buying. For example, if you buy a $1000 coin with $1000 in cash, you will receive about $900 of the coin you just bought. Coinbase charges you a high fee for holding and securing your cryptocurrency once you're ready to sell (regardless if it was for a minute or a year). Furthermore, you will receive a market buy/sell price that is far lower than the actual price of the coin you are selling. For example, if you sell the same crypto you just bought for $1000 and only got $900 in crypto, you'll earn roughly $800 in fiat. This is robbery in broad daylight, in my opinion. 

When you trade or exchange Cryptos with other Cryptos, it gets even worse. Because there is no easy way to contact these crooks, their customer service is non-existent. I hope they put an end to this open-air robbery and consider hardworking individuals like me who have lost a lot of money due to the fees these people charge.",1,4
2020-05-03,"I downloaded this app to start investing in bitcoin, and I spent a few days setting it up.

I had plenty of funds in my bank account, but every time I attempted to make a purchase the app claimed that there were no funds. I contacted my bank and they said that no one had even attempted any transactions. It was clearly a bug on their end, and when I reported it, they disabled buying on my account completely. I was unable to buy any amount of bitcoin, despite having thousands of dollars ready to transfer from my bank account. I had to sit and watch as the price of bitcoin soared, unable to buy any with the app I had spent several days setting up.

This is an easy way to get into the cryptocurrency, but for the uninitiated it is not a trading platform. GDAX is. You can fund your COINBASE account, but they neglect to tell you that you can make a GDAX account and transfer your money free of charge and buy/sell/trade for minimum fees. Limit buys and sells are free on GDAX. The pros: COINBASE is legit and GDAX is legit. They are FDIC protected and your legal tender is insured by the federal government because it‚Äôs held in an escrow account in a bank. Your coins are insured by insurance policies. BUT It would be nice to be informed ahead of time that you can incur substantially higher fees using the simplified ap and that if your going to be trading short or long term, that transferring your funds to GDAX (an actual exchange) results in much lower fees and free limit orders. 

I‚Äôm quite happy with GDAX and my only issue is the taking advantage of newbies entering this volatile market without the foreknowledge that there sister company offers extremely lower rates.",1,2
2021-02-22,"So here‚Äôs my story. I was excited to get in the crypto world and purchased about 13 K in crypto. I made an error and withdrawing funds from a money market account that only allows three withdrawals a month.  
I got a notification from coinbase stating that my account has been locked because purchases that were made we‚Äôre unable to be funded by my locked money market account. That same day I linked another account and money was in coin base covering the two other purchases that I had made. At that point coin base told me understandably that I would be locked out of any further purchases until customer service viewed my account. It took a week for customer service to get back to me. Then out of the blue they send me an email stating that they have irreversibly block my account from any other trades or crypto purchases and that I would have to liquidate my entire account and no longer be available to use coin base. Not sure why this happened and without any explanation I thought I did everything correct besides making that first mistake.
Trust me, I have a 750 plus credit rating and cash to cover more purchases.  Coinbase‚Äôs customer service did this extreme action for in my opinion was a minor error.  You make the call.",1,1
2022-03-22,"I used Coinbase for small trading and to fund other accounts that only accept crypto. For over a year my deposits and withdrawals were almost instant. Now all of a sudden if I want to withdraw any of MY money, I have to wait 18-23 days to withdraw or send anything? I called customer service and repeatedly received the scripted ‚Äúwe do this for security purposes‚Äù response. I tell them that the account is mine and so is the back account it‚Äôs linked to and ask what I can do to verify that the withdrawals are not fraud. She did not have a response so I asked to speak to a senior representative. Once the senior rep gets on the phone, I state my issue again. This person says ‚Äúlet me check on that‚Äù and then kept me on hold for over 40 minutes and counting. As I write this review I am still on hold.  It does not make sense to hold people‚Äôs money for ‚Äúsecurity purposes‚Äù but won‚Äôt allow the account holder to verify any information in order to release the funds. I‚Äôm losing hundreds/thousands of dollars because of this. As soon as my money is released I am withdrawing everything and deleting my Coinbase account. 

Update: Still on hold. It‚Äôs been an hour and 2 minutes now.",1,1
2021-02-17,"I‚Äôm giving coinbase three stars because I feel that there‚Äôs still a lot of features that are missing in this app that can make it much better. 
One of the things that first off I noticed they do not offer a grace period for their fees like many of the other apps will offer 30 days without fees but this app does not do that.
Also the app does not make it easy to see what‚Äôs been invested in the track your investments by cryptocurrency‚Äòs you actually have to click into each cryptocurrency individually to see what you purchase them at and where the current values that so it‚Äôs not easy to track your overall investment portfolio performance.
Lastly there‚Äôs no a crypto wallet or earn potential within the app you have to download a different app for that and also they list all the crypto currencies but you have to sort to ‚Äútradable‚Äù because all the cryptocurrency‚Äôs that are listed are not tradeable  in this app so it‚Äôs kind of misleading until you go to the ‚Äútradable tab‚Äù and then you can see which cryptocurrency‚Äôs or actually available to be purchased through this app.  
It‚Äôs Good but could be MUCH BETTER!",3,3
2017-12-03,"Coinbase is great. However, it takes 4-7 days for your transactions to clear when using your bank account, or linking your bank account. Even though im not planning on selling anytime soon, it shouldnt take so long for my purchases to be approved and show up in my wallet or portfolio. Also, they recommend using or linking your bank account, instead of using your debit card which is immediate and doesnt take 4-7 days to clear. Why does it take so long to clear? 
I understand that they want to make sure funds are in your account (i assume), but 4-7 days, is way too long. I dont think i can sell anything until everything has cleared. I also noticed that the $ was already taken out of my bank account- so why are they not available as soon as you have taken the money out of my account? The good thing i guess is that the price i purchased them at is locked in. But still would be nice if they were in my portfolio as soon as the money has been taken out of my account. All in all, this is a great, easy and fast way to buy crypto !",4,3
2022-10-18,"So like the title says I‚Äôve had Coinbase for over a year and am just sort of iffy about it . I think the only reason I still use it is to buy coins quick to transfer to my ledger. I don‚Äôt trust them and the info they give to the government which totally defeats the purpose of crypto, their fees are kinda expensive and annoying!! They are 100% ripping you off on the APY for cryptos such as Eth ,Ada, and more  basically halving your interest amount. They crypto availability is okay but not great and a friendly reminder that if they go bankrupt your crypto is gone and they receive your money . Coinbase one is a joke and way overpriced for what it is and your money should be safe in Coinbase anyway which says a lot about them as a company and how safe your money really is . The only saving grace is their ceo (who i like a lot ) the ease of sending crypto, and the fact they are popular enough that I  doubt they go bankrupt like voyager or Celsius ( but it could happen) . Overall be vigilant about this company and just make sure when you buy your crypto to transfer it to a hard wallet if you wanna secure your crypto.",2,2
2019-09-17,"I did everything they asked me to verify my account etc... on several occasions when I wanted to trade bitcoin my account was locked out from selling. I could convert crypto‚Äôs into others but that was it... I was restricted to conversion. I couldn‚Äôt even sell it I to the USD holding account, could not sell it to my verified checking account. Then I was told to contact support, took them forever. Denied anything was wrong and closed my support case before it was resolved several times. Bitcoin went down in that period, all crypto did... so conversion lost me money, they didn‚Äôt help... and I couldn‚Äôt sell it. And I had everything needed to do all those things! I was powerless to sell it during the downturn... so the essentially had control of my money for three months where I couldn‚Äôt do anything. That‚Äôs essentially stealing Coinbase... frustrating your clients enough where at one point I almost gave up and let you have my money, which makes me ask how many people have this issue... and why when I switched to the Cash App and did everything including setting up an account, sending the coin from you to them, selling the Bitcoin... why did that only take a day with them, and months with you?

2020-08-10,"There is no customer service number to call if anything happens to your assets, which is a very scary thought considering mistakes happen all the time with Coinbase. For example, I purchased $500 worth of a coin as it was just beginning a massive bull run. At first, the payment went through and then a week later I checked my account and all my crypto I had purchased was gone. Turns out the ‚Äúpayment had failed‚Äù even though I had well over $500 in my bank account. I contacted Coinbase through email to ask them what happened and to reimburse me for my coins, telling them I‚Äôd happily provide bank statements to prove I had the funds available. They responded with NO explanation and told me I could no longer make any purchases in the app. Their mistake has so far cost me $1200 I would have made on my trade. An institution that handles personal finances absolutely MUST have a customer service line. Can you imagine if you bank misplaced your money and you couldn‚Äôt call them to fix it? I made the trade to help pay for my dog‚Äôs life saving surgery and now after all my research, analysis, and a very smart trade, I have nothing to show for it.

2022-05-02,"I‚Äôve written reviews in the past in an attempt to bring awareness to the developers that the behavior of notifications, when interacting with them, does not work as intended. If a drop down notification appears on my phone and I interact with it, it opens the app and takes me to the price page of the token the notification was about. That is exactly what should happen. Unfortunately, after that is done, I still have a red 1 on the bell icon as well as on the app icon itself. If I already interact with the notification as it came in, I shouldn‚Äôt have to back out of that, then hit the bell icon, look at the same notification again to clear that out. It‚Äôs been this way for years now. With a recent update it‚Äôs now worse. After interacting with the drop down, backing out and then interacting with the bell icon, back out and after a few seconds the red 1 will appear for a second time forcing a second interaction with the bell icon to clear that notification. So 3 times interacting with the same notification to clear it out.

For SOME REASON, Coinbase initiated a SECOND transfer from my bank account for $25k. I DID NOT INITIATE THIS TRANSFER, and it led to overdrafting my bank account since i did not have funds for a second transfer. Not only did coinbase do this, but they also froze my coinbase account and are saying that they are going to be recovering funds. When i go to my history on coinbase, it doesn‚Äôt even reflect the second transfer - and YET i‚Äôve been getting emails about recovering funds for it, and my account has been frozen! Make it make sense. I can‚Äôt even give a reference number because there is no reflection of a second transfer when i go into the app! MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. I‚Äôm so unhappy with Coinbase.

2020-11-25,"If you want to get into crypto, you may want/have to start here, unfortunately. The crypto market is still the wild west and very difficult to figure out for the average investor.

The good: it‚Äôs safe as far as I know and I‚Äôve never had an issue with missing coins.

The bad: most of it. 
1. The transactions are very expensive. You pay high fees to purchase coins and you also pay to take your money out.

2. Annoyingly, Coinbase does not give you an average price of your purchases. Meaning, when you buy a coin at different prices the app doesn‚Äôt calculate how much you‚Äôve paid overall. If you‚Äôre buying coins over time at say $2-$5 it is up to you to sort of figure out what your baseline is, since the coin prices are constantly changing you don‚Äôt know when you could sell at a loss or at a profit. This is such a basic feature it‚Äôs mind boggling they refuse to adopt it. Robinhood has this on every purchase you make.

3. You can set up automatic payments to buy coins from the app but to stop them you have to do it through the website. This is meant to be inconvenient on purpose. 

CB adopts coins after they have ‚Äúpopped‚Äù (you miss the initial earnings) but there might be a legitimate reason for these delays so I won‚Äôt ding them on this.

Coinbase is begging for a rival app to take over. RH is a great app but they don‚Äôt seem interested in expanding their crypto coin offers. Etoro might prove to be a better app.",5,2

2022-04-21,"This is my story, which hopefully gives you a sense of what you might have to deal with. I created an account and bought some crypto. A few hours later I noticed that my account is restricted and is flagged for manual review. What I should‚Äôve done at that time was to dispute the charge on my credit card and cancel the transaction, but unfortunately I didn‚Äôt because I thought they have a legit business and will take care of it. So, I reached out to customer service and it took them several months to reply and then they asked me to upload a copy of my identity documents through some random website. Now, given that Coinbase website itself was hacked, why should I trust a random website introduced by Coinbase to upload my documents? So, I figured the amount of crypto I have in my account is not worth it to upload my documents through their method which is not safe (in my opinion. Obviously they think it‚Äôs safe, but I do not trust data safety comments from a company that has been hacked before) and might create a bigger headache for me in future. So, I gave up at this point; it doesn‚Äôt feel good though; I feel like my money is stolen.",1,2

I have not even been on the app for months so I was confused/concerned.  So I put the coinbase app back on my phone and logged in with no problem. Change my password and made sure there was no important information on there.  Then I get another email saying that I requested to change my password again.  So I again log in and change my password.  I try to call and talk to someone a person not a recording/prompt and they only allow me to put a ticket in.

When I receive my bank statement, coinbase had actually double charged my bank account. 75 twice and 100 twice. So now I have 350 deducted from my bank and only 175 in my coinbase account.

No, I then receive an email from coinbase saying I need to link another bank account to my coinbase account.

I‚Äôm not a serious or experienced trader, so this app is perfect for me.

I understand the heavy interest in crypto has bogged down support, which I have sympathy for. Expecting customers to sit on their hands for 30+ days without any response is unethical and morally demeaning. 

If you are reading this review to see if you should be downloading the Coinbase app, please do not do it. Look elsewhere.

I have sold coins with both the website and the app, and surprisingly, the iPhone app is actually easier use and offers a better user experience. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone interested in buying/selling Bitcoin!

That was frustrating. But then again they give you the option to accelerate your request with photo verification.... Well, even if you‚Äôre already verified, you need to verify it AGAIN just for that single request! What kind of BS is that? Well it gets worse.

No matter what I do, how many times I try, they fail my attempts. Fine. Fine! So after that I canceled my larger request and went with a much smaller 400 dollar withdrawal to another address.

Gives easy access to cryptocurrency trading. 
‚ÄúInstant‚Äù deposits. (More on this below.)
App is user friendly and simple. 

CONS:
Gives easy access to cryptocurrency trading. 
Instant deposits allow purchases, positive cash flow is needed for high frequency trading. (Duh)
App is way too simple. Even Pro is too limited. We need far more functionality and features. Tracking data of trades etc etc. Charts need improvement. Other Apps should not rival a Billion dollar company in tracking cryptocurrency. You need better CS. Use TDA as your model, not RbnHd.
It should be more clear when funds have cleared the bank, and when cryptocurrency becomes transferable. The Portfolio should only have assets managed in list form. A ‚ÄùCoin List‚Äù can show all coins available, tradable, etc, and a Watchlist are in dire need of inclusion. I also don‚Äôt understand the multiple app approach. Account privilege status should be set up in an account hierarchy that grants access to higher levels within the App, not split up into separate Apps. 

Over all great experience so far. Reliable yet limited, but does what it does well. Let your deposits clear before you transfer coin. Know the limitations and pray for updates.

I swear to you I‚Äôve been trying to withdraw my money from this app since April and when I reached out to customer service to get help they locked my account, have been ignoring me, and keep marking my issue as handled. I invested about $100 but it‚Äôs unfortunate that these people do not care who they‚Äôre doing what to. I am a single mom and literally was just trying to jump on the train of returns and it‚Äôs not even the dip that‚Äôs screwing me but the actual company. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt recommend investing in this app at all. They don‚Äôt even have customer service. And I have PLENTY of receipts. Just because of the way they are going about the situation Im not letting this go. Too many people invest in these apps and imagine if 400K of the 1.4 million who just REVIEWED the app put in $5-$250 and can‚Äôt even get their money back!!!!????? Some people even invest $1000s. So what do you do when the app is STEALING???!!! Modern day freaking robbery. And I‚Äôm not about to be quiet about it.

Everything is a drop-down computer box. If you call one of the numbers all you get is computers telling you to go back to customer support online.

Next problem, at watching the market to buy in at the right price for me and sell at the right point, Bitcoin suspends trading!. Your fees for transactions are down right insane and day light robbery. You have zero customer service and never get back to anyone. You do not have a direct number customer service number. You‚Äôre excuse for suspended trading due to high volume of trades or customer interest is a joke.

2021-12-05,"Coinbase has been having connection issues for over a week and will not allow any trading, buying or selling from app. They have essentially hijacked my money and won‚Äôt let me do anything with it. Worst crypto app ever. Would give 0 stars if possible. Cost me to lose a lot of money by not being able to manage my crypto when the market was up. Now I have lost all my gains by not being able to sell when prices were up high. Absolutely just highway robbery and they charge you an arm and a leg for fees to move your money around if you actually can move it.

Update:  I have tried uninstalling the app, resetting my phone, logging in and out, but nothing is working.  I have now lost over $120 by not being able to sell or trade my crypto on Coinbase.  Worst off, all I get in responses is the generic ‚Äúplease reinstall the app‚Äù or ‚Äúreset your phone‚Äù.  It took over a month to even get that response from Coinbase.

There‚Äôs no pull to refresh on the Trade tab. The shutter button on the ID verification camera screen is behind the tab bar buttons. It‚Äôs overall just a terrible user experience.

About a year ago none of these problems existed. All that said, then service in general is spotty. They will lock down withdrawals of all your crypto for a month with no way to unlock them ‚Äúfor your safety‚Äù and because ‚Äúit‚Äôs standard coinbase policy.‚Äù Anything past simple requests and support is not helpful at all.

2021-03-06,"I made a transaction to transfer money from my checking account on the 16th of Feb. Coinbase pulled another transaction from my checking account for the same amount on the 17th of Feb which I never requested. AND most importantly my account in Coinbase never reflected it so that money just disappeared. It left my checking but was never received into my account.

I disputed the charge with my bank and Coinbase and was refunded the extra transfer amount. However, a few days later Coinbase sent me an email stating they were going to collect the debt to them in 15 days from my current balance (coins I had previously purchased). So I emailed them literally 7 times and opened cases which were never resolved and they didn‚Äôt help me but they still closed each case stating the issue was resolved.

They literally stole my money. I am reporting them to the better business bureau and their customer support is non existent so please refrain from using this platform.

2020-12-08,If you want to entrust investing in an crypto app that has absolutely zero support when issues go wrong then Coinbase is the place to go. Since the world of investing in crypto is new there can be growing pains. I mistakingly sent a transaction to an email address instead of a wallet and attempts to get corrected are abysmal. The FAQ‚Äôs say if a mistake was made wait 30 days for a reversal and if still not rectified contact support. There‚Äôs the rub...You have to email support and finding the right tree structure for this type of problem was difficult. Post submitting my email I got a resolution reply from Coinbase noting my ticket was closed. 2 more attempts to get corrected through this email channel available all resulted in the same automatic closing of my ticket. I assume they auto close without a human ever even reading and reaching out to me to resolve. No way to resolve my issue and if you try to call the posted 888 number they only will let you speak to a live person if you think you have a security breach. The regulators hopefully will review their practices but until they evolve stay away.,1,1
2021-05-16,"I am enjoying Coinbase, I want to link my bank account but I the app states that I cannot for some reason. I started an account using my debit card and I have deposited funds through the Coinbase app into crypto. It is easy to transfer funds from one type of crypto currency to another. I am signed up to make periodic deposits/payments automatically to invest more funds via my debit card, yet I cannot make a deposit payment into my checking account? It does not really make sense that the app can take payments from me but I cannot withdraw funds. This is problematic, and makes me hesitant about investing more funds using the app, which is a shame because that is obviously what I want to do. One of the crypto-currencies supported by the app is designed to make it easier for people to send and receive money. This is ironic considering that the app itself is limiting in this way that I have described.",4,2
2021-09-06,"I‚Äôve been added to the long list of horror stories with Coinbase. I had an issue with my Coinbase, submitted a support ticket, and without any communication they decided to lock me out of my own account. 
It‚Äôs been weeks, I still am locked out with no answers. I‚Äôve submitted an official complaint via the Coinbase website but still haven‚Äôt heard anything. I even reached out to u/coinbasesupport via Reddit, they didn‚Äôt respond to me either. Zero stars simply because of customer service. I have a big bag of crypto sitting on a locked Coinbase account, with no one to talk with or contact about it. It‚Äôs sickening. I have zero control of what‚Äôs going on. I plan to take legal action if they continue to ignore my official complaint since there is a time frame that they are obliged to respond by. Seems like they are overwhelmed with support cases and have no way to actually get to all of them.

2021-12-24,"As a new user of Coinbase I was really excited to see the vast number of cryptocurrencies available on the platform. Right away I began trading and everything was very easy to navigate. The platform is visually pleasing, easy to use and get started, and also offers a wide selection of coins to trade from. 

My only complaint is that there is no (easy) way to see how much I‚Äôve gained or lost since the time of purchase. What I mean by this is that on other trading apps when you buy a coin/stock you are able to immediately see how much the value has increased or decreased which gives you a good indication of when to sell and how to track gains and losses. 

Unless I am mistaken, the Coinbase app doesn‚Äôt offer this feature. You can see the current price of the asset and how much it has gone up within a specific time frame and your current balance in local currency as well as the conversion amount (e.g. 
         $512
          0.01 BTC
)

I would really like to see Coinbase add another drop down option on the ‚ÄúYour Assets‚Äù page that shows exactly how much the value of each asset has changed since the original purchase as well as its current value. 

(E.g.
 
Bitcoin           $50,000   <‚Äî current price
                     +$1,000     <‚Äî change in value since time of purchase

)

I hope this finds the right person or team. 

Cheers!",4,3
2021-01-31,"The app is useful, good looking, and easy to use, but possesses a critical flaw that no financial app should contain. During app setup, the user is prompted to set up two-factor authentication via SMS (the only option available). SMS is not a secure 2FA medium. Hackers and scammers have several tools in their arsenals by which SMS messages can be intercepted, socially engineered, or faked. SIM swapping attacks are a good example of this. This exposes end users to the potential loss of their crypto-currencies, while believing they are ""secure"". As a better form of security, Coinbase should add support for both hardware (yubikey etc.) and software authenticator apps to better secure users' crypto assets. In the meantime, users should use all, or a combination of the following: Use a UNIQUE/strong password for this application (ideally generated by a password manager) that is used nowhere else. Set up a PIN or additional security with their mobile provider. Use an offline hardware device like the Ledger Nano X to store crypto currencies when not actively trading or transferring assets.",3,3
2019-01-11,"Be very wary before signing up with this service. I sold some bitcoin and during the process of trying to deposit the cash from the sale into my account, I accidentally made a deposit into my coinbase cash account from my bank account (hit the wrong button). I tried to rectify my mistake by transferring the whole amount back to my bank account, but it would only let me do half. I assumed it was so they had time for the funds to transfer from my bank to theirs so I waited a couple of business days and tried again. No luck. So now it has been 11 days and they still won‚Äôt release the funds so I can transfer it back to my bank account. I have no idea why they need to hold my money this long. I am sure it has long been deposited into their account because my account was debited 11 days ago. I am very frustrated that they are preventing me from getting money back that belongs to me. I wrote their CS department on about 5 separate occasions and get the same run around each time. I wanted to give them a chance to make things right before going this route. Be very wary before using this company.

The history of my transfers  suggested the same, yet my Coinbase portfolio was higher for the amount of $130. The same amount was showing being transferred on my bank account. I am 100% positive that I never initiated that amount. It took about two weeks for the amount to become available so I could transfer it back to my bank. That was strange and I guess it will remain mystery. Secondly, it doesn‚Äôt show clear (or not at all actually) how much we are in gain or loss for each crypto we own. Also, when we go to ‚Äúprofile‚Äù page, it shows cryptos that we don‚Äôt own. It‚Äôs just disappointing all around.

Now I have a considerable amount of money in a cryptocurrency, subject to its volatility, that I cannot use for the purpose that I purchased it. This is unacceptable and doesn‚Äôt make sense.

2021-11-18,Sadly their fees are ridiculously high. I was trading on Robinhood for free and very happy.  I wanted to buy Solana and Robinhood did not offer it so I went to Coinbase.   I then thought I would use this app and company to handle my crypto trades.  They charge high fees when buying and converting cash to crypto or crypto to cash. Also if you trade one crypto for another they ding you too even though they advertise they don‚Äôt charge for exchanging crypto. Seems to me they are basically like some of the big banks just interested in making money charging you for fees for everything. Things are not very transparent either.  For example trying to calculate your gains and losses is not possible on the app. You have to track your purchase price vs the market prices. Robinhood makes this very easy so it can be done but feels like Coinbase just wants to keep you in the dark on whether you are making money or losing your shirt.  It‚Äôs very burdensome to manage your investments in my opinion. I am looking for a new trading platform.,2,2

2020-04-20,"I‚Äôve been using Coinbase for over a month and have made a number of trades.  Reading some of the reviews prompted this one.  Where exactly is all the money from the high fees going if the company hasn‚Äôt even bothered setting up a proper customer service channel??

What I can comment on is the high fees for sub par service.  Because I am wondering what exactly those fees are paying for.  The charts and info available are very limited and the prices when you go to buy, sell, and I‚Äôm wanting to say even convert raises an eyebrow on occasion.  

I wasn‚Äôt planning on withdrawing my money from Coinbase for the foreseeable future, but after using it for a month, I will be looking into better options and take it from there.  But yeah, it‚Äôs pretty bad that Coinbase doesn‚Äôt have some kind of call center for customer service.",2,2

The minute you have to contact them you will probably conclude that your money is safer elsewhere. & It's fine to have customer service representatives to answer basic questions but there should be people knowledgeable about crypto to speak to when you have significant money invested with a company. Per more than one ""rep"" there is ""no one else to speak to"" HOWEVER they are happy to email you articles so you can answer your own questions. I am done with coinbase",1,2
2021-04-27,The data you want to evaluate your investment is just not there. For example in Robinhood - it tells you how much you have made or lost each day on your investment and it tells you how much in total you have lost or made on that invest since your first transaction. You can create separate lists just for your investments in Robinhood. The transactions take FOREVER to finalize- which is really insane since this is supposedly based off a blockchain and it should be instantaneous! You get notified days and days later that a transaction has finally gone through when you thought it had days beforehand. It appeared that it had because the money was ‚Äúavailable‚Äù but apparently technically it wasn‚Äôt yet. They just fronted you the money. It becomes very confusing when you are a moderate to heavy trader. I wish I could say there is a better app for this but none of them are user friendly. If you want to trade certain cryptos then you have to use certain apps. There is no app that does them all so at least for now this app is a necessary evil.,1,1
2018-01-06,"Great app, but with serious stability issues. Crashes usually involve a blue screen or login screen. The last problem is resolved if you close the app completely and then start over.

My biggest complaint is your absolutely stupid and inadequate account verification system. I submitted my ID 5 times and your system fails to verify it. I‚Äôve written to customer support, but they referred me to a help article, which provided basic instructions on submitting an ID. Clearly, submitting an ID is not an issue, when your stupid system doesn‚Äôt recognize it. What‚Äôs annoying, it took Coinbase about a week to come back to me with this canned response; you would think one week would be enough to come up with a personalized response with details as to why the system can‚Äôt recognize my ID. I always thought Fidelity was a crappy broker - until I started using your service - you have the crappiest app / website and customer service on the street. Brian, why give an interview to Bloomberg about your focus on customer experience, when your service can‚Äôt even get account verification right...",1,2
2022-09-13,Coin base please‚Ä¶ So I try your advanced trading for the first time ever but then I‚Äôm seeing ‚Äúsorry connection error‚Äù on my pc and phone but like this is something you have had a problem with for months I feel like at this point your service issues is a disservice because we are storing our ‚Äúassets‚Äù with you and honestly that‚Äôs not safe there are people with hundreds of thousands of dollars in blockchain assets and how can we trust you as investors if your platform isn‚Äôt safe or trustworthy on a consistent basis longer than 7 days. So as someone you use your service I do and many other also have assets stored with you and we will highly appreciate if any developers and at least buckle down on the connection issues. At least if you want good standing with community I love your interface but blow your competitors out of the water by ironing the issues that are dangerous like being in a trade and having a connection error is scary.,3,3
2021-05-07,"This is by far the easiest app to use to start investing in crypto. I‚Äôve tried the others and some of them I can‚Äôt even get started they are so complicated. This app lets you simply transfer money to your account using one of several methods and buy what you want quickly. I use the transfer via PayPal which is extremely easy and fast. It also has an easy to read display and a not confusing or complicated like the other apps. 

One recommendation for the developer would be to not start off asking for info when I first download and open the app. Let me see the app and features  first to feel comfortable with it, then let‚Äôs talk about my personal details. I understand they are required by law to invest, but having to hand them out before I even know I want to use your app made me feel uncomfortable and not wanting to proceed.",4,5

2022-05-10,"I believe ALGO staking is done since April unless you sign up for it which your platform, Coinbase, doesn't have. 
I've been using Coinbase since February of 2021. The hidden fees were a trip trying to figure out around that time. Yes I'm glad you all decided to show how much it'll be for the network fee. I'm not a fan of the other hidden fee that most people who are just starting out may not even know about. Coinbase should state how much it'll be to transfer one crypto to the other before hitting the submit button. 

I've also seen a lot of great changes but some changes were making me think someone must have been really toasted while programming. 

For those out there who should know, try to not use your real cell phone number. Years ago it was about hiding your ss number. Now it's about your phone number. Use something like MySudo and use that free number only for this platform. 
I read through the comments and see people say they've been getting hack while having such and such amount of dollars. Do you really trust this company with that amount of money? Look into cold storage wallets and hodl on those. 

I rate this app 4/5 because it's still a great app. Easy to understand for the most part when starting out. 

Keep up the great work and listen to your customers. Thank you",4,4

I‚Äôve gone through each step their website offers to try to resolve the issue, but they simply left the account as is, unverified, and said it‚Äôs been resolved. They never reached out for any further clarification. In their FAQ section, it turns out they don‚Äôt really have a remedy for this situation, but essentially have shrugged off responsibility and tell their customers that if they‚Äôre in my situation, they‚Äôre simply out of luck. It‚Äôs 2021, and frankly the combo of no customer service beyond impersonal emails and account actions is completely unacceptable, especially when finances are involved.

2022-02-08,"Coinbase did a decent job for me for a few years. I don‚Äôt really trade just buy and hold unless something drastic happens.

They just changed policies and kept me from my money until I clicked agree. I didn‚Äôt agree and couldn‚Äôt access my funds. Customer service finally answered my call and did nothing for me except send me an email with a link on how to close your account. I followed that link and tried to close my account. They informed me I still had money in my account. I told them I know I have money in my account but can‚Äôt access it because I don‚Äôt agree to your terms.

I need my money back extremely bad, and now I must wait for my ticket to be answered, which your auto reply says could take days due to high traffic. 

It doesn't take a super server to handle queries like ""fetch a number"". You guys need to up your game. I can barely ever check the price of a bitcoin. Therefore I am unable to buy or sell bitcoins. You guys purposely slow your speeds down to disable people from selling their bitcoins. Seriously, if you're going to handle as many clients as you have, and you make as much money you do with your fees, how about give back to us with the very small service that you are supposed to provide. ""Ohh no lots of people are requesting a 1 bit number, our servers are slow now"". You're not fooling anyone.",1,1
2022-03-29,"I have used Coinbase for several years. Recently, however, the app glitched during a purchase and accidentally made a duplicate purchase. I was unable to do anything about it so reached out to support. There is no one live you can talk to so I was forced to submit my request and wait for an email correspondence. Even though I submitted very thorough documentation outlining exactly what happened (which included two simultaneous transactions that could not have possibly both been initiated by me), I was tossed around from several different people over email who continued to misunderstand the situation. After 2.5weeks of back and forth emails, I received no resolution and then Coinbase sold the duplicate transaction (again without authorization or warning), but at a significant loss since BTC had crashed. All said, 2 unauthorized transactions, terrible customer support, and a ~$4000 loss all because of Coinbase‚Äôs incompetency.

2021-02-28,I opened a checking account specifically to fund my Coinbase account. I transferred money into this account as well as depositing cash. I made 8 purchases through Coinbase . Then the problems began . Problem one My bank froze my account because they didn‚Äôt recognize the transfer . I fixed that problem but it was too late . Then Coinbase began reversing the purchases . Yes I was trying to make the payments but now they would not accept my bank account . There is ZERO customer support from Coinbase . They shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to do business if they cannot help their customers. So then 2 of my purchases went through as I was able to fix things on my end . Well those purchases where then stolen from my account by Coinbase and I have not received a refund or any support as to what is happening. My free crypto that I earned was also taken from my account . I doubt I will ever be able to get any help from Coinbase . They basically say you can‚Äôt call us and we probably won‚Äôt be able to help you if anything goes wrong . I would not recommend this company .,1,1
2019-05-10,"I have been very disappointed with the update that has been published to this application. Four instance of the graphics that show the prices of assets is now completely unusable. The biggest flaw that it has is the inability to see from the screen what is going on with the price in the last hour or so. Even zooming in on the our view does not help because the latest information is cut off. Thankfully there are other places where this information is available however not having clear visibility on the asset prices and their latest development makes it very difficult to plan without using another reference. The team also changed how the graphic is presented into an even more difficult to understand version of the price history.

2022-05-06,"I was going to use my account again and realized the phone number was outdated with one I do not remember. I followed the steps concerning not having access to old phone. It still asked old phone to be verified. Phone service would not put me through with verifying old phone. I then emailed service and was told to do what I have already tried. After explaining that, I was told to go create a new account with a new email and submit info with my ID so Coinbase can determine if they will allow me access to update my phone on old account. The whole time, we are emailing from the email on my current account. A whole lot of trouble I do not have time for. When a phone number is changed, why do these companies expect you to keep the old number active?

That‚Äôs a little update to the old stuff now the new:
Sold my shares and withdrew my funds to be deposited in my bank. That was two weeks ago. It says it was done but the money is not in my account and my account was disconnected from Coinbase. So now I have to contact them to get this rectified. 
Save yourself the time, money and head ache. Use something else. Most people don‚Äôt see the small discrepancies or they don‚Äôt experience then yet because they are selling or withdrawing. I don‚Äôt trust them and I wish I read through all of the reviews before I risked my money like I did",1,1

On the business level: small hiccups with ID verification, terrible support for customers that change their country, inexistent customer service and high fees for trading.
On the app level: the UI seems to deteriorate over time. Whereas back when coinbase would only support 2/3 cryptos it was easy to see their trends and easy to see where the market is going, now all the relevant information is hidden behind a bunch of clicks. An attempt to mimic Robinhood with some information about the coin and news also takes up room from what could be potentially more interesting info.

There are people who never found a solution and have been continuously ignored by Coinbase support. If they can resolve this issue I would have no problem changing my review, but more people need to be made aware of this issue because it seems like this is just out of negligence on Coinbase‚Äôs part.

2021-12-08,I recently joined coinbase about a month ago. Since then ive had multiple problems with the app and ive tried contacting coinbase but they have the worst customer service out there. Waited on hold for about 2 hours on a Wednesday morning. Given it said estimated wait time was 35 minutes. Tried using there online customer service on there webpage and it was no help as well. Finally got through to someone on the phone and the gentlemen that helped me was very polite (Name: Owen). He was not able to help with my problem and just connected me to another hold line. Waited again on hold for about another 40 minutes before I just gave up. In total wasted about 4 hours of my day trying to fix this problem and in conclusion nothing came of it. This is why I will be swithcing to an alternative platform. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND all others to do so as well.

I just can‚Äôt see all coins listed when I type some alt coins in. Also some coins aren‚Äôt tradable. I do like the coins listed. But coinbase seems to have a limit of value.

2021-01-25,"Its an easy to use app but there are a few issues that have made me not like this app as much as I did at first.

First and foremost is while monitoring ETH I ‚Äútraded‚Äù at 1395, selling 5 ETH for USD. On the sales report it said the trade price was $1381 A 14$ DIFFERENCE! I sit there and refresh the price constantly, and it hadn‚Äôt been $1381 for at least 5 minutes. So getting jilted out of $14 x 5 coins plus their high fees ate up almost 20% of my trade. Thats after fees just to buy coins too. Not very impressed and kind of sketchy if you ask me. 

Next is an interface issue. When you want to put your USD$ back into your linked bank acct you have to select the ‚Äúwithdraw‚Äù option instead of the ‚Äúdeposit‚Äù option. You are withdrawing the cash from the app acct back into your bank acct and a deposit pulls money out of your bank and deposits it into your app acct. This unclear wording made me nearly overdraw and even worse, since it takes my bank a few days to process the transaction (both withdraw and deposit), I had no access to my money for over a week which was frustrating. 

Another issue is the fees themselves. Very high if you‚Äôre trying to do times trades. 

Last issue off the top of my head is the lack of Monero trading. 

Its a good app for beginners who just want to learn I suppose but I‚Äôm a bit disappointed in the discrepancy between my sale trade price and their reported sale trade price which seemed dishonest.",2,3

Even if other apps charge high fees as well, it would be nice if they take the route that other investment banks have taken lately to offer zero to very low fees for trades. Another piece of constructive criticism I must give though would be for the app to better explain in detail what your net gain is compared to the amount of money you have invested. That way your not just looking at a broad percentage between all your currencies or having to sit and do the math yourself based on how much I‚Äôve invested verses it‚Äôs current value of each individual one. Other then that it‚Äôs great! üëç and I highly recommend for anyone interested in trading bitcoin or any other crypto.",5,4
2021-02-21,"I‚Äôve had Coinbase on my phone for almost a year now, and though the fees were ridiculously high for swing trading, at least the the app was informative. After the upgrade, you can no longer see spark lines in the watch list (at least I think that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre called), and even worse, you don‚Äôt see the whole range of price for coins you‚Äôre trading anymore. By that I mean, if a certain coin is at let‚Äôs say .56, you don‚Äôt see the small changes within the cent range, such as: .5648 and so on. Now it‚Äôs just rounded up or down to the nearest cent. That‚Äôs huge if you want to make quick moves within a cent range for small gains on low priced coins! It‚Äôs like they decided ‚ÄúHmmm, this app is too user friendly and we can‚Äôt screw people out of as much money now. Seems pretty sus to me. How this app still has 5 stars is a mystery to me. Read the reviews thoroughly. Its pretty clear people are frustrated too and moving to different platforms to trade. Please Bring back the old layout Coinbase!!!!",1,4

I had to liquidate all my positions, suffered a great amount of fees and faults and all I can say is that I won‚Äôt leave it at there but a company claiming to be in the crypto business but is no wear near designed to have that much attention. 

Shame on them. The bureaus will be receiving my report.",5,1

2021-07-28,"Coinbase is an app for iOS and other OSs that is also an Internet based wallet you can keep your funds in or transfer it to your hardware wallet.  It is also available as a website.

Coinbase is so much more than just a simple exchange though.  It offers individualized charts of your portfolio including charts of individual currencies and up-to-date pricing charts for many popular currencies.

It also keeps you updated on the latest news articles from authoritative sources updated on an hourly basis.  Coinbase charges fees scaled on the amount of cash you spend and allows you to use PayPal.  I usually buy $26 allotments of currency at a fee of $1.49.  You can buy up to $50 for $1.99.  So the more you spend the less you pay in fees but I am simply an enthusiast.

I see the potential of crypto currency and want a piece of it.  I dabble with it at the moment to see how I do and then down the road who knows.  I never ever invest money I can‚Äôt afford to lose, so no harm to me if the bottom falls out of the market however disappointing that may be.  I am careful to diversify my holdings and buy from more than one exchange.  Coinbase however is definitely the most informative and useful exchange I use.",5,5
2021-02-13,"Interface is easy to use and very easy to become accommodated with the functions. However, I used the referral link to invite my roommate who then followed the requirement of purchasing $100 worth of crypto (they purchased $105 actually) and over 6 weeks later, neither of us has received the $10 in free Stellar Lumens. I‚Äôve emailed support 3 times now and only get an automated reply saying they‚Äôre receiving too many emails and responses may be delayed. At the time, XLM was around $.24 a token and they‚Äôre currently sitting at $.57. $10 or $20 may not be a lot, but it‚Äôs the principle. It‚Äôs good business to honor that which you advertise. Since this dilemma, I‚Äôve started using Gemini and Exodus more often. They have honored their referral rewards so I believe they may be more honest and appreciative of the business on their platform. Hoping this is eventually resolved, but I suppose time will tell. Make sure you only invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose! But there are other, more honest and sincere exchanges and wallets.",2,3
2018-09-17,"So I‚Äôve been using Coinbase for about a year and some change now and slowly it‚Äôs started to go down. I synced up my bank account because it has a higher buy per week and I‚Äôve done this multiple times before so I went to purchase some BTC and for the first time in, let‚Äôs say 18 months, I had a 20 day fraud hold put on my purchase. I sent in help tickets and emails back and forth verifying I made the purchase, I went and verified my drivers license as well as a selfie (they requested I do it to show someone didn‚Äôt snag my license) and STILL it didn‚Äôt release. Finally one day it released and I had about 15% taken out to which they said that was due to the fluctuation of BTC cost. If they didn‚Äôt put the fraud hold on it, I would‚Äôve had ALL of what I purchased (minus the small fee). Then today I went on to look at my balance and everything because something in my mind was telling me to look at my account and BAM the fraud hold is back on my account and I have a balance of $0 for the next 2 days....no help from customer service or the company.

Anyways, I tried to get a new one but DMV is pretty slow, DMV gave me a temporary paper to drive instead so I couldn't get a renewed DL to show them. Coinbase do not accept passports (which is absurd) and they don't give you alternatives to the DL, they don't want to help you at all.

2020-08-07,DO NOT USE COINBASE!!!! I am a current client. Long story short I was super excited to open an account. All my other friends use Uphold. They told me not to come to Coinbase but did I listen? No. So I opened an account. Added my bank account and purchased a hefty amount of crypto. I purchased 3 different types. Long story short a few days later. I went to purchase more and they kept failing my transactions saying that my bank said I had insufficient funds. I had plentyyyyyyyy Of money in my account. However I called my bank and they there is no issues or hold ups. Mind you this took a couple of Hours to get straight. Well the stock I was wanting to invest to make profits in ended up sky rocketing and I couldn‚Äôt get any transactions because their system would not allow me to spend money. Well now fast forward 6+ days and they finally get back to me with no customer service that actually would take care of me. Do not go here. Don‚Äôt spend money here. Go to any other place for your fiat currency switch. They do not care about their clients at Coinbase.,1,1
2020-06-01,This app could‚Äôve been great. But I‚Äôm not going to discuss with could‚Äôve been. The fact is they have the most horrible and I mean the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my existence. They disable me from purchasing cryptocurrency with no explanation whatsoever their customer service told me that it can take 5 to 10 business days or even more for someone to get back to me but I guess I‚Äôm on the ‚Äúmore‚Äù end of that process because it‚Äôs been over 3 months and no one has gotten back to me and no one responds to or answers any of my correspondences. They have no respect for the customers whatsoever I highly suggest that no one waste their time utilizing this app anymore because once something goes wrong you‚Äôre left alone to handle it.

2021-12-18,"There hasn‚Äôt been one update lately that actually helps your clients. For example you removed the charts for almost every screen to make your users have a harder time figuring out how a crypto is doing that day. You still refuse to hire customer service. Which is probably one of the most garbage ways of running a company that involves peoples money. The amount of people that have problems with what you do as a company would make you think you would try to change things to become a better company for your users. But that‚Äôs not the case. So if you‚Äôre not doing these updates to help your users, who are you doing them for? This app has become a shell of itself in just that last several months.

From there, I was denied usage because of the ID verification process. I provided my valid NJ drivers license multiple times, but was rejected each time. When contacting Coinbase support, they told me to repeat the process and take a selfie. After this attempt, I was told that my ID name (Jonathan K Van Dongen) does not match my Legal Name (Jonathan Van Dongen), which is obviously absurd. They have repeatedly sent me the same message to use the 3-picture verification without any additional support and will not let me talk to a Coinbase support specialist ‚Äúfor security reasons‚Äù.

As soon as you‚Äôre ready to play with the high-rollers, just switch over to their professional-trader sister site GDAX (which you can log into with your Coinbase account).

Where is VOC when it comes to major updates like these? Or you just let your product managers run the show to create ‚Äòwork‚Äô so they appear busy with scrum calls?

Coinbase Pro was so good when it came to looking at charts or placing orders. 

However, this app is a trash, here is why:

1. I literally had to search where and how to add funds. Was the UX designer intern and not FTE ? Did you guys do any usability studies? Give this app to 100 random people and see how many can figure out how to add funds in first minute.

2. The charts are messed up no matter you use candle or lines. Once you pinch to adjust x axis or y axis, it gets messed up and makes it impossible to read. 

3. The order entry mechanism has been made unnecessarily complex. You have to use the back arrow to change the default price. 

4. There is a lot of self promotion going on on the ‚Äòasset‚Äô tab. I want to see my assets, period. Don‚Äôt waste the real estate there with some fluff stuff.

Overall a BIG disappointment! 
This is a serious business involving money. Why would you mess something that is already working, aka Coinbase Pro just so that your product team has something to work (mess up) on ?

2021-12-08,"Overall great app in basically every way you could ask for. My only complaint is I have whiplash from all of the UI updates. Today it changed for, I believe, the fourth time in 2021. And all these updates ever change is that they remove the little chart preview on the asset tile that you can see before you click to open it. And then within a few weeks it‚Äôs back again. Just decide‚ÄîI don‚Äôt care what you do, just decide lol. It‚Äôs extremely disorienting to have UI change this often, and it‚Äôs unprecedented for an application that has this high a profile.

Also, this UI update shortened the watchlist to 4 and put a ‚Äúview more‚Äù button there instead of allowing you to scroll through your watchlist. In what way could that be viewed as an improvement?",4,4
2018-10-03,"DO NOT buy crypto on Coinbase under no circumstances.  It is now become more useless and obsolete.  With instant buy with just a few hundred bucks they now hold your crypto for about 5 days. Not only you pay higher fee but can also result is massive loss.  ACH transfer take 1-2 days. Wire transfer take 2-3 days. Instant buy with Coinbase now hold your coin for about 5 days. To make the matter worse.  I transferred some BTC from other account to then deposit into GDAX to convert to ETHER but they clump that deposit into
My just recent instant guy ETHER and restrict withdrawal as well. What a piece of junk!!! Buy from Coinbase now very risky because they hold your coin 4-7 days which can result in massive loss if market crash.  Their supportive staff are mindless drones and will keep telling you the same answer over and over again.  No help!!!",5,1
2021-02-19,I‚Äôm new to crypto and some people told me to use Coinbase. So I figured I would give it the good ol college try. So I downloaded it tuesday.  Verified my savings (which the wife didn‚Äôt like) so then I verified my checking and deleted my savings.  bought $300 worth of crypto with my checking and it was all good. So Thursday morning I bought another $40 worth and then Thursday night I get an e mail saying there was something wrong with my bank account. Looked at my account and they took the money out already which was good but weird. So I tried to verify my account again and it won‚Äôt let me. Says there‚Äôs a connection problem and I try to verify it again and it says I have maxed out my attempts to verify and to try again in 7 days. I wanted to put another $200 in today but I can‚Äôt because I can‚Äôt add an account. Idk if it‚Äôs a glitch or what is going on. So i sent them a e mail since that‚Äôs the only way you can get ahold of them. Waiting for a response and all I wanted to do was add more money. üò°,1,1
2021-10-15,"This is for anyone and *everyone*. 
Easy set-up, easy execution, easy, easy, easy. 
For a long while, I had hesitated (for a myriad of reasons) to buy into crypto. 
After doing more digging, research and reading (personally recommend ‚ÄúBitcoin Billionaires‚Äù for a fun Bitcoin / crypto broad strokes overview/explanation), I joined the mass movement‚Ä¶like a skeptical and inexperienced swimmer testing the ocean w her toe. 
Since I was not planning on becoming a crypto genius (i.e., willing to spend only minimal time/effort), I reviewed options and ultimately downloaded Coinbase. Friends of mine registered for other platforms around the same time. Side by side comparison and returns: for managing my modest approach to crypto, Coinbase exceeds my needs. 
Some of my friends with other platforms have expressed extreme frustration with lagging transition times and limitations of their chosen platforms. . . But, they may be attempting more complex transactions than me? Perhaps they‚Äôd have the same issues w Coinbase? ‚Ä¶
So far, I love how simple this app makes crypto transactions. Couple clicks and done, and my relative return seems on par w others who got in at the same time, so I take that to mean, less effort and same results = a positive review.",5,5
2018-01-28,"Easy to use but they charge excessive fees. Also defeats the purpose of Bitcoin because they are basically the ‚Äúbank‚Äù. Many other options out there. If you send Bitcoin to an address that they don‚Äôt like or feel you should transact with, they close your account, hold your funds and then after a while you can send them to another Bitcoin wallet.

Why are they tracking and analyzing where you send your Bitcoin? I know they have to do verification and prevent fraud/illegal activity since you can fund with a bank account or credit card. But send BTC to an address they flag as violating their TOS and you‚Äôre out. Even if you send BTC to a friend or someone else who has sent BTC to one of their flagged addresses and you‚Äôre out. Their not only tracking who you send/receive BTC to but also who your sender/receiver has transacted with. If you do use them to buy BTC, transfer it out of there as soon as you can. You don‚Äôt own the private key to the wallet, it‚Äôs stored on their servers and they log and track every move you make.",1,2
2023-06-13,"Frustrating how many issues I have had with the Coinbase Card rewards and the issues never get resolved even after contacting support. Support just opens a ticket, and quietly forgets and ignores the request. I've had multiple transactions that say they paid out the reward but never actually did, and a couple that are months old that took the money for the transaction but the reward state is stuck in pending. It's not exactly the app's fault, and overall CB is a good fiat on off ramp for US citizens, but support is basically non existent. The interface of the app is slightly annoying. Should be able to customize the layout to what we use the most, and whenever I need to input 2 factor auth it opens a web view, auto focuses the input, and immediately the input is no longer active so I have to touch the input again. It's a bug that's existed for close to a year and still hasnt been fixed.",2,2
2022-09-13,"Unfortunately on 9/4/22 my acccount got hacked. What‚Äôs most upsetting is that Coinbase did nothing to alert me about this. I called Coinbase support on 9/12 since I was not able to access my account and they told me all the crypto I invested in my account were sold and someone added a debit card to withdraw funds out. Coinbase support is HORRIBLE. I have tried reaching out to CEO, tried escalating as much as I can but Coinbase is taking no responsibility. As a publicly traded company and a company which I pay a service fee for each transaction, I cannot believe their response. If you lost your savings wouldn‚Äôt you expect a company try to find the source and provide some type of response / call from management taking responsibility for their actions? No such response here. I will never invest in crypto through Coinbase again. I strongly DO NOT recommend this platform. I am a verified user who had an account for 3 years until today.",1,1
2021-07-01,"I just recently got into investing and buying stocks. And someone told me about Coinbase so I thought I‚Äôd check it out. It is honestly great, simple easy to use. One thing I wish they would add is something like what robinhood has where in the portfolio you can choose either to display the last price, percent change, total returns. That would be helpful instead of having to manually click each crypto and see how much I originally spent on it vs what it is at now. Also..... and I can not stress this enough, can we please get DARK MODE. Robinhood has one and so do many other apps. My eyes can‚Äôt take it. So yea overall, great app.

Edit: They finally added dark more. Now my eyes won‚Äôt feel like I stared at the sun for too long.",5,4

Another problem is the fact that no safeguards are in place to prevent one from sending coins from a wallet to a different wallet without warnings.  For example if you send bitcoin cash from coinbase to yobit.  There is a very big problem and coinbase does not care to help.  Thats wrong, and very bad because money is being stolen/lost/misplaced.  Many have researched into this and there are ways to et those funds back.  But untill you guys care to help here at coinbase nothing can be done unless one started a class action lawsuit and put a lean on all your assets and funds!  Hope these things get worked out.  Hate seeing people lose money they rightfully deserve.  One star only until that gets fixed and my $500+ of bitcoincash get returned!  4 stars if you guys fix your problems.  Till then id give half a star if i could.",1,1
2020-12-19,"I have been using coinbase for 2 years now. It‚Äôs been great in terms of trading, sending and depositing cryptocurrencies. However, DO NOT USE THE VAULT OF ANY KIND. If you like quick trades do not use the vault. They lack telling you that it takes 48+ hours to withdraw your coins back into your exchange wallet to sell/convert. Completely ruins your advantage in the market because the market could drop in 48+ hours. I put the plus because it was much longer and after a certain point they just stopped updating me. Updates are sparse, leave you hanging and don‚Äôt count down. I had 1.25 ETH ($830 USD) and couldn‚Äôt do a thing with it in the meantime, stressing the whole time.

2021-10-05,"I downloaded, signed up and set up the app and am active in using it. The app disappeared from my phone as soon as I installed it.

I have uninstalled/deleted and reinstalled the app from the App Store and still no app on my phone. Please help. Thank you.

Long story short. 

I purchase assets system stalls for about an hour or longer then later goes through. 

Days later Coinbase comes and reversed the transaction sending the funds back to the bank triggering a RETURN charge to the account that has and also had the funds available for the purchase. 

I made a ticket for resolution Coinbase apologizes for the mistake and in about a day replies and says everything is resolved. 

My account has been locked now for over 30 days an counting.  No Trades! 

Asked Coinbase about this issue and was told not to contact about this issue again for another 30 days. No Trades!

2022-08-18,Coinbase continues to put out more products and asks its users to download those apps and use the services. The latest example is Coinbase One in which they asked me to sign up for a beta version. I apparently signed up for it without knowing they would charge $30 a month for it if I didn‚Äôt cancel. I was charged for two months of the service not knowing this and had not used it once. It took me hours and hours to figure why I was being charged. When I finally figured it out I was then told they wouldn‚Äôt refund me because of their ‚Äúterms of service‚Äù. If you are not going to refund users for these type of things and make them run in circles to get help with the issue it is irresponsible to make it so easy to opt in to the service.

I decided to check my ‚Äúlearn and earn‚Äù assets in my coinbase wallet. For those who don‚Äôt know, this ‚Äúlearn and earn‚Äù feature allows users to gain dollar value rewards on different crypto coins offered through the app. In my experience, some will earn you as low as $3 and as high as $10.
However, when I check my assets, I can only see the price per coin for the transactions that i‚Äôve paid for out of my pocket?? Any other coin that I haven‚Äôt paid for personally(including the coins and rewards gifted to me by coinbase) isn‚Äôt able to give me any information as to what price the coin was when I received it from these reward programs?

DO NOT USE APPLE PAY: There‚Äôs a chance they will decline the transaction and then drop your all of your debit card limits to $0.00. This app somehow manages to get worse with each update.

The instant transfer option isn‚Äôt instant. So if it doesn‚Äôt go through ‚Äî say if you don‚Äôt have enough money to cover the withdrawal ‚Äî Coinbase will prevent you from conducting transactions and inform you that you owe them for the purchase of the cryptocurrency. 

The kicker is that you can‚Äôt pay them back with a debit card; it has to be through a bank and connected through Plaid which supports mostly traditional institutions such as Bank of America, Chase, etc. 

I don‚Äôt have and do not want traditional banking. So I‚Äôm basically punished for it by the website and app. 

 Ironically, the bank account I originally used‚Äîwhich wasn‚Äôt a traditional bank and had to be connected for the transaction‚Äîwas still connected. 

Even with the money to cover the original transaction ‚Äî they can‚Äôt process it. So I‚Äôm up the creek without a paddle.

Quick Facts:
A. Been a member since 2017
B. Bought coins and were left in my cb account since then.
C. Account was verified.

Present:
A. Bought btc on 09 Mar and received initial hold for 20 days. Policy is only 3-5 business days or upto 10 calendar days. Like my previous purchase written above.

B. Called support for review of my account and increase my dc/cc purchase limits. Received email of request, decision/reply within 4-6 business days. It was passed 4 days with no response. 

C. Called support again for the same reason. Support reassured that my btc purchase is there because they could see the transaction. and again, a ticket was sent with the same caption 4-6 days turn around time.  Nope no response again regarding the case, nor from any specialist. 

D. Checked my CB app some days later and to my whopping surprise, my hold days increased from the initial 20 days (it was counting down btw) to 99 day hold. No joke. So i called support again, and heard the same old excuses, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll look into it‚Äù, ‚Äúdont worry sir, our specialist will review this matter‚Äù.   What a big wonkers CB app process has become.

I don‚Äôt think so because most people are scared to  get loans, And at the Max apy % is 5% and only on Cosmo
And no other crypto is their to invest in which could make life better what most users desire is at least 15% apy and that amount can actually help especially when the economy is in negative inflation 
I hope i made some sense that the users desire more because your company does have fees right? No one works for free right?  so do more to provide a broad spectrum to choose from to earn more apy% rather than surviving on 5% apy its just not enough hopefully in the b Beginning of 2022 or before summer otherwise ill gladly choose another platform, i only came to Coinbase because of the company out reach to crypto community which is fading away please offer more apy% more than 5%

I honestly question if they do this to many and then just take your money? It‚Äôs almost impossible to reach anyone here and takes a week for them to reply to emails. Garbage company, there are many others that are WAY better. And don‚Äôt steal money.",1,1
2021-04-05,"Firstly I‚Äôd like to start by saying that I started off really enjoying coinbase. Everything was going great. I really liked this app and it‚Äôs features. However if I could I‚Äôd give this app no stars. The reason I am writing this review is because I have only had my account for less than 8 weeks and have been locked out of it for 6. I immediately contacted coinbase support and was told my issue would be resolved in something like 4-7 business days. It has been over a month. Since then I haven‚Äôt even been able to log in let alone trade. When a company has your money they shouldn‚Äôt keep you from accessing it like this. This is absolutely unacceptable and unless my issue gets resolved this negative review stands.

Update: Dec. 16, 2020

Still no access to my account. My initial review was posted some time in October after a month of not having access to my account. Don‚Äôt use this app unless you want you money taken from you.

Update: Mar. 28, 2021 

After months of being ghosted, I was finally reached out to for my account to reactivated. This whole ordeal was very annoying however, upon signing into my account, I did see that my investments had appreciated in value substantially. Maybe it was a good thing I didn‚Äôt have access to my account, but it is still something I hope to never have to deal with again. Coinbase, you may have kept a customer today, but know you are treading on thin ice.",1,1
2020-12-22,"Terrible apps. Extremely difficult to sign up. Coinbase and Coinbase pro apps asked for my ID, which I ‚Äúsuccessfully‚Äù submitted. After ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù submission, the apps kept telling me that ID verification was necessary, but provided no further guidance nor a link for whatever was necessary, even after having accepted my submission. I finally used the computer based platform, which again asked for my ID, but also a ‚Äúselfie‚Äù. After several attempts, I was finally successful on the computer platform. Please note that the mobile platforms themselves inexplicably provided no guidance in this process (a simple message such as ‚Äúusing the computer based platform is necessary for this step‚Äù would have sufficed). 

Now that I‚Äôm certified with a linked bank account, Coinbase works however inexplicably buys are disabled on Coinbase pro. Absolutely no guidance is provided as to why. Can somebody please explain how Coinbase allows me to buy but pro does not? These are linked services!

Please note that customer service is essentially not available. They do not respond to emails, which is their only available means of ‚Äúcustomer support.‚Äù Apparently phone support is only available if you feel your account has been compromised.

This is deplorable. How am I supposed to feel comfortable investing serious money on this platform when I can‚Äôt even talk to a person nor can the platform guide me throw any issues that may arise?",1,1
2019-06-26,"I wanted to deposit my funds in my bank account but instead accidentally deposited that amount into my coinbase account. Once I tried to reverse it, I couldn‚Äôt get a hold of anyone at their support team to reverse this. I decided to call my bank to block the transaction and now that they did, coinbase is threatening to liquidate my remaining assets into cash unless paid. This is awesome too because since my bank account blocked the transaction, they removed it from my account. So I write this review while currently being on hold for +30 minutes to finally put a voice to this company and app. Had they made it clear I was depositing more funds into my account vs what a normal person would assume a deposit for their bank account to be (money back in) then I could have avoided this whole process. Will not be doing anymore business until they improve something or maybe add a reverse option for a transaction within the first 5-10 mins of making it.",1,1
2023-01-22,"I originally downloaded coin base because of their advertisement that you can get free crypto simply by learning about it. After I signed up with them I found out that‚Äôs just not true I have not been able to earn anything like that. I then decided to go ahead and put a small amount into crypto so I bought a couple different ones. They charged me 50% online it says they only charge half of a percent but that‚Äôs not true they took half of what I put in.

Update.

I kept the app for some time and built a bit of money in it slowly. That was fine until I went to close my account and withdraw my funds. After several weeks of trying and after talking to multiple reps I finally was able to close my account but I had to forfeit the money in there because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to withdraw it all. This is really the biggest scam I have ever fallen for. I‚Äôm just happy my account won‚Äôt occur anymore charges from them.",1,1
2022-11-16,"Whereas I enjoy the layout of the page, many functions are difficult at times. For instance, I can‚Äôt send a token out. It keeps saying it has pasted my address but it has not. Little glitches like this.
You put in a max purchase and it does not accept when you think it has because once it adds the coin base fee is now more than what‚Äôs in your account and you don‚Äôt realize this.
Overall it‚Äôs good. If for some reason your bank declines a $10 deposit and you have $100,000 in assets in your Coinbase account, they will lock you out for upwards of five days! Even though you have that much money in there, your assets will be frozen.
Yes they have the regulatory coverage of United States were as offshore do not. But, I would use multiple platforms. Because Coinbase can be extremely frustrating.",3,3
2022-01-01,"I like coinbase as a company and as an app, but they really need to step up and create a more open user friendly support team, real people you can get on a phone call with, and offer better security support. I hope coinbase invests in hiring more people in those areas. I do not have full confidence in the security of my holdings if I‚Äôm compromised on my end, coinbase does little to offer me assurances. If you get hacked then chances are they will be in and out faster than you. You will be stuck dealing with the aftermath for ages while coinbase will be slow to respond or halt fraudulent or suspicious activities. If I can prove that I was hacked I want a guarantee that coinbase will credit the stolen funds and that it won‚Äôt just be stuck all being my fault. This is a security that people will pay for, if offered.",3,3

Update May 19th 2021. I reached out to Coinbase support on May 7th and haven‚Äôt received a response or resolution it is now May 19th. This  unsupportive platform need to work on putting there customer needs first! They don‚Äôt have a direct line to contact them unless you have a Coinbase card. And online support hasn‚Äôt given any information on this transfer issue. Attempting to transfer my crypto from Coinbase has been a hassle with no update on their end.

2018-10-01,"Sure the layout is pretty, and it seems straightforward. But the second you decide you want to buy, sell or especially send/receive digital currency, the nightmare will begin. You will be asked to verify your identity no less than 15 times during your stay with Coinbase. And each time you finally get it to work, a week later it will all disappear and you will have to submit it all again. During that time, they will lock you out of your funds and not allow you to send or receive anything. Also, there is virtually no customer support with this company. If you run into errors or problems with the platform (and you will), they will not help you with anything over the phone and they very rarely reply to emails. I would say to stay far away from this company, but you really don‚Äôt have any other choice if looking to buy digital currency while also being able to send/receive it. Good luck.",1,1
2018-01-06,"The Ap itself works great, very easy to use and set up. Times for approval for your account aren‚Äôt to bad, setting up payment methods are easy enough but do take some time to be verified, upwards of a week and a half. Once you‚Äôre set up getting money from your bank account to the wallet will take yet another week however Coinbase gladly withdrawals those funds that day. CC/Debit card however is instant, with a 20$ fee for your troubles. Once you have money in your wallet you can purchase any of the 4 currencies instantly. However if you plan on moving this Cyrpto anywhere else look forward for up to 24hr delays. Ironic considering blockchain technology is supposed to be near instant transfer time. This company has already been accused of insider trading, combined with at best suspect transfer times from wallet to market. User beware",4,3

Good morning, and in. Are I don‚Äôt see ya; Good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight!

Wow, where do I start!? 

I‚Äôve been using this app ‚Äòfrom day one son!‚Äù. Yes, day ‚òùÔ∏è. I absolutely love it, and recommend all users, especially ‚Äònewbs‚Äô,  (new people to crypto) to use this route when purchasing cryptocurrency! 

It‚Äôs super simple and easy to use. This app is without a doubt the most intuitive, no B/S, straight to the point way to get started with crypto. 

I am very well versed when it comes to tech and the UX (User Experience), as I develop massive interfaces for entire buildings, commercial, residential, and business, home automation systems. I‚Äôve made user interfaces for every type of system you can think of. What I‚Äôm saying is, the UX plays a major part of an apps ‚Äòmake it or break it‚Äô Philosophy. If an app is to difficult to navigate, it can break a company. Well this app definitely meets, and exceeds, this. 

Anyone looking to get into crypto, if you don‚Äôt start here, you will never make it. 

Get this app people! It will change your life forever!",5,5
2022-08-05,"So I stopped using this app months ago when cryptocurrencies started crashing earlier in the year. Out of the blue, I received a charge for a coinbase pro subscription that I had never subscribed to. I had no funds in my account and hadn‚Äôt even opened the app in months. I called customer support to request a refund for this charge and was told I could not get a refund because coinbase pro subscriptions are non-refundable. I was told to file a complaint which I did.  I received no follow up or call back number to address this issue. Less than two hours later I received an e-mail saying that my complaint had been reviewed and I would not be receiving a refund. I understand that crypto is not doing so well right now and Coinbase probably needs all the money they can get‚Ä¶but charging my card without my consent is completely unacceptable. This app is not secure and customer service is terrible!",1,1
2022-07-21,"It‚Äôs all fun and games until they randomly decide to lock your funds up, claiming ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù. It was not my first time using Coinbase, nor the bank account associated through Coinbase. I even used it the day before and I was able to transfer my funds just fine. However, this time they decide to put a ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù lock on my funds with no way to revoke the lock. This resulted in potentially thousands of dollars worth of missed opportunities and all I can do is accept that because ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù. If you need to put a security lock on someone‚Äôs account, a simple verification of your identity should be enough.

Edit: I‚Äôm an idiot. I told my self I‚Äôd never use Coinbase again and I did. Go figure, it ended up being another terrible experience. 4 failed transactions later and I‚Äôm still unable to send my own money to myself. If anyone has ever had a good experience with Coinbase, let me know, because this company looks like a joke if you ask me.",1,1
2021-10-28,"This is solely based off the support system for this app. 

I have not been able to trade since I‚Äôve downloaded the app a year ago. I set up my banking information added $10 to test it out and immediately after I was confirmed, I was restricted and my account was disabled from trading. I tried to read through the Q&A myself to see if I could find the issue. I could not. Thinking it was a glitch or bug I deleted the app and forgot about it the last few months. 

I re-downloaded it today (months later)  hoping to start trading but my account is still restricted. (Even though I‚Äôve put money in it they stole the 10 I added when I first downloaded the app. Because it‚Äôs not there now.) But their support system will ask you two questions and you‚Äôre able to give one word answers (convenient) then it‚Äôll disconnect the chat and send you to a message board.

 Why have the automated chat if we have to go to a inquiry board and hand fill it out anyways ? It‚Äôs not to better help direct questions to the correct person because you have the option to change that. And why have the automated chat if we‚Äôre still going to be put on a email complaint list that won‚Äôt get back to anyone till a year later?

3. No ability to choose a limit price. Other exchanges are basically dictating the prices of these coins and your customers are being forced to place limitless orders, which may or may not really screw them over. Limits should be reasonable because frankly, [see number 1] and we are paying way over market value when all is said and done.

I have tried to contact customer service to no avail. I only pray the information I provided is not used against me, or used to steal my identity.

Apparently if you want to convert from one coin to another you need to withdraw to fiat currency. There appears however to be no way to do this internally since you can not buy coin from the cash wallet, only through a linked bank account or debit card. Each one of these transfers generates additional fees‚Äîgreat for Coinbase‚Äîbad for the investor who wishes to change holdings on a timely basis.

Would you want to trade ethereum to bitcoin? Done in a second.  Wana buy 500$ of doge and convert to stellar lumens and then back to doge? In a moment.

2023-05-01,"If you don‚Äôt mind having your account put on hold (unable to send crypto out of Coinbase) then Coinbase is probably a fine platform for you. 

However, I do mind having my money frozen. ACH deposits will always be put on hold. The way around that is to use a debit card so the transaction clears instantly and you (in theory) should be able to send your crypto out of Coinbase right away. But Coinbase will make up all kinds of reasons to put your account on hold so that you can‚Äôt send out crypto. 1st they put a 3 day hold on my account to verify my ID (which I had already done when I opened the account). They asked me to do this 3 times! I have a normal state driver‚Äôs license and the pictures were crystal clear. Then once they verified that (again), they put my account on hold for 24 hours stating they didn‚Äôt recognize my IP address. I‚Äôve been using the same iPhone for years. I don‚Äôt use VPN and I use the Coinbase app. I tried to make my case in a support chat, but they don‚Äôt care.

Honestly, I bank with BoA and I‚Äôve never had them freeze my account and ask me to reverify my ID or because of an IP address.

2022-01-25,"Short version: I do not recommend this app because of the lack of transparency, lack of proper service, and misinformation. I will be canceling my account ASAP. Furthermore, Coinbase charges more fees than other apps.

Long version: I purchased Bitcoin today for a total of $1,000 because Coinbase stated that you could send up to $1,000 per day instantly. It was not until AFTER I made the purchase, I was informed I would need to verify my identity (which apparently I cannot do because I updated my ID today and only have a paper copy that Coinbase does not accept). Had they stated they were going to require this, I would not have made the purchase. 

Their site says they are available 24/7 via phone. This was a lie as the recording stated ‚ÄúAt this time, live support is not available‚Äù. If this is the case, they should update this on their site. 

I contacted someone from their chat who was equally unable to be of service. It will take 3 days for this transaction to go through since they will not allow me to verify my identity (which is going to cost me around $100 in profit I would gained had I been able to transfer the funds sooner).

I seriously recommend making the app a bit more data oriented with some DYNAMIC CHARTS and even SORT options on the watchlist and coin explore pages.

A little finesse and you will surely reclaim millions of users who have left negative reviews based on their experiences. This was the first app that I really stuck with all the way through my many years in crypto and I‚Äôd love to see it flourish and blossom into a masterpiece.

 One random day my account got hacked/compromised completely and I can‚Äôt even get in my account anymore. Coinbase doesn‚Äôt even have the decency to get back to me, being such a big company I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be that way. A lot of hard earned money and gains lost in an instant not to mention my SSN, BANK INFO and more so easily taken over from my control by someone with nothing but an automated voice call with coinbase and unresponsive emails from there customer service.

I don‚Äôt really like how certain crypto isn‚Äôt supported, but it does at least provide information about them. I also don‚Äôt like the process it takes to be able to recover your account, if you don‚Äôt have access to the phone number related to your account it will take a few days before you gain access again. There should be other features where you don‚Äôt have to solely rely on a phone number for account recovery. Other than that I have no complaints.

2020-05-27,"The customer service is impersonal.  Everything is e-mail based.  While it is a new concept, the speed at which claims are processed is subpar compared to current industry standards.  If a claim is not resolved to your expectations, or it was misinterpreted by the team, then a follow up response will take as long as it did the first time the original claim was submitted.  The claim resolution time is 5 days, so between each response, provided that they don‚Äôt resolve your issue the first time, it can take 20 days for your problem to be resolved.  In the meantime, your assets‚Äô value can deteriorate while you are still waiting for a resolution.  If you are in the corporate world and are used to address your issues immediately and get it resolved yesterday like you demand from your work team, Coinbase is not the place for you.  Fortunately, I opened accounts simultaneously in a couple of other platforms and did not have an issue.",1,2

Shortly after I placed these transactions the market began to increase again so I missed the opportunity to make money during the dip. I am extremely frustrated - if I can‚Äôt take advantage of low prices then what is the point? I will be doing some research and taking my business elsewhere. The crypto market is volatile and if their servers cannot handle the increase in activity then I cannot trust this company with my money. I have seen so many similar complaints from others on Twitter that experienced the exact same problem.",1,1

After four years queen bass has earned my trust by virtue of their efficient app, reliable content of the industry, and most importantly, on the occasions I have needed customer service help, they‚Äôve been extremely responsive and helpful, which is not often the case when dealing with Internet-based only companies.

2017-10-05,"Coinbase is great at selling you BTC/LTC/ETH. And they do a pretty good job of allowing you to sell on their exchange. But that‚Äôs about it. The app leaves a ton to be desired in the areas of tax reporting, understanding profits/losses, documenting buying/selling fees (which are tax deductible, but you better write them down bc they are recorded nowhere after the initial purchase/sale), and some basic and advanced chart analytics (like volume, highs/lows, etc.)

They are king and on top here in the US, but this space is ripe for disruption if a competitor launch in more fully featured exchange app that was blessed off by SEC and regulators. I hope Coinbase continues to improve and provide advanced functionality. Lord knows they‚Äôre collecting enough in fees to finance some of these suggested improvements.",5,4

Which would be fine, if the photo-taking for the selfie on their platform worked correctly. But it doesn‚Äôt.

So here I am, locked out of my account indefinitely. The moment I get back in, if I even do, I am moving everything out of Coinbase and going elsewhere.

Got my account verified by sending the required front and back of drivers license, reconnected each account and still unable to complete transaction. 

I contacted customer service, they took a week to respond, asking me to verify my account and this time they want me to send them my drivers license again and ‚Äúrealtime‚Äù selfie? 

Oddly enough, my debit card magically started working and now I have up to a $100 dollar purchasing limit, which I will just stick to from now on.üôÑ

There is KYC, and there is intrusion. Coinbase would be so much better if they learn the difference between the two. 

My brother and a friend had the same problem and it was fixed on the Coinbase side of things, no selfies involved. What‚Äôs up with that?

I didn‚Äôt update or log into my account for nearly 2 years I just watched a small balance. Then I wished to purchase coins again, I had a very great experience resetting my password and being able to have control of my wallet. It took a little time; about 20-30 minutes to cross reference and verify it was my wallet I was accessing and bringing back to life. This absolutely sold me on the reliability of this app. Coinbase could be the best service I have used in 2020. In uncertain times it‚Äôs very beneficial to have a partner likeCoinbase watching a small amount of my assets. Thanks for being reliable.

Coinbase made an unauthorized debit to my account therefore overdrafting it and when I reached out three days ago, they still haven‚Äôt responded. If their customer service wasn‚Äôt a pile of garbage then the review would‚Äôve been quite good, but alas, they need to learn how to manage that end of their application.

2017-12-12,"So the app is cool but could definitely be improved. If you‚Äôre new to crypto currency then Coinbase is a great place to start. It really simplify things...oversimplifies.  

For example, there is information present on your web-based account that isn‚Äôt in the app (like when the cryto currency you bought is actually going to show up in your account...I had no clue it would take a week from purchase to actually see the currency hit your wallet). There are also limited discretionary warnings to inform you of such issues (given my previous example, the little as ‚Äò30 minutes‚Äô before your wallet updates is just not true). 

Lastly, you can‚Äôt actually access support from the app. It sends you to the website, make you log in again, somehow make you log in one more time and then finally you can talk to a bot that really isn‚Äôt all that helpful. Also, if you log out of the app, upon logging on again, you have to set everything again (passcodes, price alarms) forcing you to constantly have the app going in the background. 

My overall opinion, what‚Äôs the point of having an app, outside of spot checking prices...which some will argue you should not be CONSTANTLY checking anyhow, if it has far less usability than the website?

I‚Äôm done, for now.

***UPDATE***

The app is TRASH!!! Good for checking prices quickly. Beyond that, just use the website.",1,3

I just recently deposited an amount of money that will cover my purchase easily and every time I try to buy it says my account is empty. Then when I try to specify the amount of coin I want to purchase it says invalid(). I have taken screenshots of everything that went wrong today and I wanted to upload them to someone on ‚ÄúLive Chat‚Äù Option within the app but it turns out that‚Äôs a bot. It hasn‚Äôt even been a year since I last used the app but what ever happened is very discouraging from me returning I will most likely just withdraw my funds and use another broker.,5,1

The Help Center is a computer that responds via messaging system and it is of NO HELP What So Ever. None of my credentials have changed, the email advised me it does not recognize my credentials. 
I have patience, this issue is the hard at I have encountered in order to access my account and yet, I have still been unsuccessful. I am not happy by far, communication with a computer, that is absurd.

That said, I have rated this 4 stars as I think there is one feature that it would be helpful to have added.  This would be the ability to set an ‚Äúprice up to‚Äù or a ‚Äúprice falls below price‚Äù alert like you can do in the stock trading Fidelity app.  This way, we can assign a price that we‚Äôd want to buy or sell at for a respective coin and have the app send a notification when it hits those marks so we can logon to Coinbase and try to get in before the price either goes up or drops; depending on what your looking to get alerted about.

2021-05-24,"Initially I attempted to link my bank account to purchase currencies; the app would say successfully linked but purchasing was never successful and it would tell me to try another method of payment.
When I would retry, the app would insist the account is linked. After multiple attempts, I reached out to the support in which it took days for a response and finally a answer that did not resolve the issue.
Ultimately I used my card, but it is limited to $750 a time in which I have to pay a fee every time to equal the amount I would do one time if the system would allow me to use my bank account. For example a $3,000 purchase now has to be broken down to 4 $750 payments at around $28 dollars a piece in fees...so basically $114 in fees that would have just been 1 $28 dollar fee.",3,1

The second is trying to send funds to a different wallet address.

2020-12-11,Coinbase is great for those new to crypto. The fees are a little on the higher side of exchanges but I personally don‚Äôt mind paying the fee for the easy to use app interface and the ability to take full custody of your tokens and assets. The Coinbase Earn program is a great way to learn about crypto while earning a few tokens here and there. I would love to see a limit buy/sell option to make dollar cost averaging more profitable but I guess that‚Äôs where an exchange like Coinbase Pro and Kraken become beneficial. Coinbase has a bad reputation for app crashes when Bitcoin is making big moves up or down due to heavy traffic. This also makes it difficult to maximize profits when you can‚Äôt buy the dip due to app issues. But overall it‚Äôs a great app for those new to the crypto space.,4,4

First, the transaction fee for sending btc is outrageous- over 20%. But that‚Äôs fine, whatever. 
I sent two amounts to an online company to complete a purchase. The second one went through in about 6 hours, but the first one (for all of $60) was ‚Äúpending‚Äù for over 26 hours and my window to make payment closed. As soon as the window closed, my transaction finally went through 
During that time I submitted multiple requests to customer service- no help. Just a canned response directing me to their (no) help page. I responded explaining the timing issue- no response. I sent another message showing that my window had expired and asked for my transaction fee to be returned- no response. 
Fortunately the 3rd party receiving the btc returned them (charging me another fee) was charged $25 to send two small amounts and then $15 for them to be returned... all because this app couldn‚Äôt complete my transaction and the ‚Äúcustomer support‚Äù didn‚Äôt think my issue was worthy of their time.

That's WELL over a 30% charge in FEES just to send a currency over. Not to mention just to make trading worth while, you must make over 5% in equity because 2% will always go to them for buying and an additional 2-5% or more to them when they sell your cryptocurrency for a much lower value than the actual value. For example, BTC will be valued at $15,900 and they will sell your BTC to you for $15,500 and keep the $400 value in BTC for themselves. That's another 3% they are taking!!!

I do what they ask and send the documents, then 5 days later while I also have thousands of dollars in there that are now basically locked away, they finally contact me and say the the bank statement I sent isn‚Äôt valid because they don‚Äôt accept bank statements from credit unions‚Ä¶ then I can‚Äôt get a hold of anybody for over a week, I emailed at least 3 or 4 times talked to multiple robots and no agents and that was that. Horrible company, horrible customer service. Hide yo mom, hide yo wife, if you or anyone you know has an account with coinbase I would be afraid",1,1
2022-06-05,"App is very user friendly. Ive had no issues with the app itself. However the support team is horrendous. If you have any issues, they just simply read set lines back to you and dont actually help with the problem. 

For example my accounts been locked for two weeks now (after using for the past two years) with no explanation at all. I have assets such as litecoin just sitting there, unable to transfer, unable to sell, unable to do anything with. When i contact support they just say that theres nothing they can do and that the team will review. Ive now lost money due to this and theres nothing i can do about it. 

I would not suggest this app. Theres plenty others out there that dont just steal funds from you.",3,2
2021-09-07,"When it comes to looking for a proper exchange for crypto or any other needs, the most important aspect is reliability. I foolishly thought that, by being charged fees on every purchase or sell, this meant Coinbase would be superior than Robinhood which offered free trading. And how wrong I was. Your ability to buy on the app has been down on a day when the crypto market flash crashed and several saw this as a prime opportunity to ‚Äúbuy the dip.‚Äù Coinbase did their part by crashing themselves for 6 hours and counting. 

Not only is that unacceptable, they still haven‚Äôt resolved the hold on my bank for when I attempted to purchase crypto‚Ä¶ 6 hours ago. According to many others, it will most likely get canceled, effectively holding my money hostage while the market continues to go back up. For those looking for a reliable service, look elsewhere because Coinbase is a joke.",1,1
2019-06-25,I had trouble getting into my old account since I lost the phone I had. They told me to make a ‚Äútemporary‚Äù account and verify my ID so I did and they were supposed to give me access to my old account and close the temporary account once I did that. I‚Äôve been emailing them for 2 weeks because they haven‚Äôt responded at all. After 2 weeks I get an email saying my case has been closed?? I‚Äôm still locked out of my old account. Every time I call they say they will forward it to a specialist and that they will email me when they can and now the case is closed without them even resolving it???? Now whenever I call I have to be on hold for 15 minutes before getting hung up on. I can‚Äôt get through to anyone now. So I guess my money is gone and I‚Äôll never get it back. Don‚Äôt waist your time with this app! If you ever get a new phone number or lose your phone they will avoid you and won‚Äôt help at all.,1,1

The trading platform it self it‚Äôs very clean and easy to work with. My purchase power limit its very week and I have plenty of funds but I can only buy x amount per week, this system of purchase it‚Äôs frustrating. But my main concern is if there‚Äôs a major problem there‚Äôs no one to talk to for customers service over the phone. This company needs improvement quickly on this matter.",5,2

They have been down quite a bit and sure overwhelmed due to the recent popularity explosion and uprise of Bitcoin value but come on get some technical help and more support personnel you guys are making a fortune right now you can afford it!

2022-04-29,They shave off the buying and selling prices listed when you trade. I have a few different accounts including Coinbase pro. I‚Äôll trade at the exact same time on both accounts and only make 7-8 percent on my Coinbase account and make 10 percent on my Coinbase pro account. I pay a transaction fee on each Coinbase pro trade. I pay $30 a month on my Coinbase account for free trades but it‚Äôs not really free because the poor buying and selling prices make up for it. Example: a coin is selling for 1.00 on both platforms. I buy a coin for 1.00 on Coinbase pro for 1.00 minus fees turns out to be .95. On Coinbase I do the same purchase within one minute of the first on Coinbase pro and I get the same .95 on Coinbase even with free trades that paid for. It‚Äôs a rip off. They make up for the ‚Äúfree trade‚Äù by skimming off the sale and buying prices. Try it out.,2,1

2022-04-04,They have lots of cryptos but their data is suspect.  They fee you to death and fees are very high.  Sometimes I‚Äôll show a chunk of balance missing but then recovers later.  Technical glitches galore. Don‚Äôt trust your money with these people.  Many have had their accounts robbed. Many news reports about this.  I transferred money back to my bank account. App says completed.  No money was received at my bank account. They told me to call my bank. Not their problem.  Their support is pretty much non existent.  Starts with a useless bot to waste your time. Ask for a real person and get another bot with a name. Call and get support from India that reads screens from a bot and cannot find any answers. Avoid the aggravation. Trades limited to simple market orders.  Exchanges are supposed to be free but always lose significant money on them. They provide almost zero record keeping.  Just tax info on your gains.,1,1
2021-01-20,"The app could definitely use some UI upgrades and new features a more options on alert selection would be nice the learn and earn program is neat and is attractive to new users provided they make it off the waiting list but Compound which I recently finished doesn‚Äôt let me get the $10 for 1 course and if it‚Äôs not offered is should be removed instead of paused as this is false advertising and you can do better. I‚Äôm currently mentioning the app to friends and now waiting to see if 2 $10 referral for other crypto work I hope it does

(iPad Pro users with keyboards would appreciate this, I‚Äôm sure.) Tried CoinbasePro and couldn‚Äôt sync my account/wallets to it, which I‚Äôm okay with calling a user error as I didn‚Äôt spend too much time looking into it.

I couldnt access my money for over 3 years I filed a complaint and was in the process of taking them to small claims court. they just unlocked my account today & all my assets dropped in price since i‚Äôve been locked out so i only got half my money back. moral of the story don‚Äôt put your money in their hands. I had over $400 in my account at the time & over those years I was out of work for a while and needed my money but couldn't access it. i had to take out a small loan to pay a bill which is ridiculous.

2022-11-10,"Each time after logging in, I‚Äôm kicked out and asked to log in again. Using latest iPhone 14 Pro in latest iOS. Only happens to this app. Other crypto apps work just fine. When I log in through a browser, everything is fine.

Update: Dev responded and told me to delete the app, which I did. Then, I was able to log in. All was good. Couple days later, the app asked me to log in again. And now it‚Äôs the same problem again - it logs in and kicks me out. So I have to basically delete the app and reinstall every time I want to log in. 

I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out why they did away with Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX). I used it via a browser for several years and it was my favorite way to trade. This new Coinbase app and advanced trading is just beyond terrible. Worst crypto app of all. Extremely confusing. I have no idea how place an order or how to deposit/withdraw my funds.",1,1

2021-05-13,I love trading on Coinbase so far and have really enjoyed all the resources available but it doesn‚Äôt keep you updated on what your average price is or specific details about your own portfolio. It gives you details on the crypto itself but doesn‚Äôt specify how it relates back to your account and what you have invested. You can go and look at the individual details of each transaction you complete but if you have multiple transactions with a specific crypto it doesn‚Äôt put those together to tell you how much you have and at what average price you have it. A couple other things along those lines exist in the app (hoping it changes moving forward) but all in all it‚Äôs a good app.,4,4
2022-01-25,"Scammers have ruined the forex trading market and this company is one of them. They have deceived many people with their fake promises on high returns. I learnt my lesson the hard way.

Please try and make your researches, you will definitely come across better and reliable forex trading agencies that would help you yield profit and not ripping off your money. Also, if your money has been ripped-off by these scammers, you can report to a regulated crypto investigative unit who make use of software to get money back (hackermanisoc (@) gmail dot com). He is a recovery expert and a very professional one at that.",5,1
2017-12-10,"The setup is extremely easy and it seems fairly secure so far. There is something you need to understand about pricing though. The buy and sell prices have fees of about 1.5% for all trades on top of the $1 fee they show you. This means when the value is listed at $145 for LTC, you pay about $147 and vice versa for selling. This percent fee is not directly shown but instead modified the per coin price when buying or selling.

This is still a great app for managing funds but with a little extra time and patience to learn a little more, this app is best paired with GDAX. They are owned by the same company and funds can be directly transferred for free between GDAX and Coinbase. Use GDAX for precise trading and Coinbase for more long term trading and mobile management of funds.",4,4
2021-09-04,"Coinbase got me into crypto back in 2017, and wow, it‚Äôs been quite the ride. Throughout the journey, Coinbase has been improving and getting faster and more efficient since I first downloaded it, and I love the new assets coming in every so often. The UI is also super easy to navigate and very professional looking, I would recommend Coinbase to anyone looking to get into crypto, as it‚Äôs a great place to start. One thing I wish the devs would add, however, is a profit/loss over the day/all-time. It would be nice to see how well my investments are doing over time. Other than that though it‚Äôs a great app and I‚Äôve never had any detrimental issues. 5/5 stars",5,5

2021-07-29,"This apps interface is very user friendly and good to learn the space for beginners. However, if (more like WHEN) you experience any issues (app bugs, system errors, unexplained account suspensions/restrictions all for absolutely no reason) Coinbase support only has a phone line for their card holders and that is it. You‚Äôre sole point of contact is a form online and hoping they get back to you within the month while all of your assets are frozen!! 

Start with Kraken or Gemini and save yourself the hassle later down the road. Everyone that has this problem has switched exchanges, however Coinbase makes this very hard for you to transfer funds (system error, application bug).

Their support center took 4 days to escalate the situation and are now saying it will take at least 5-7 business days, maybe longer for the specialist to look at it. The Coinbase pro exchange itself is pretty good with low fees and good charting, just hope you never have an issue you want fixed in a timely manner.
*Update*
I‚Äôd verified finally. I have full access on the Coinbase brokerage but trading is still disabled on Coinbase pro. Every few days they tell me the issue is fixed when it is not.

2017-12-28,"I used this app to invest a couple weeks ago. I invested almost $600 in bitcoin. I am a recent finance graduate and I knew bitcoin would go up in value for another week or so before crashing.

About a week and a half after I initially purchased, bitcoin began declining extremely rapidly. I tried to sell, as I had made a pretty good profit.

But as it turns out, Coinbase STILL HADN‚ÄôT PROCESSED MY TRANSACTION. It said it was still ‚Äúpending‚Äù because I used a bank account, not a card. It won‚Äôt let me sell. It‚Äôs been another week, and bitcoin has now dropped from $19,000 to $12,000, and I am STILL unable to sell. I am being forced to lose about $300 at this rate until my transaction goes through.

The very nature of the bitcoin market is that it‚Äôs a short term investment. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason it should take Coinbase 10 business days to process a transaction. At this rate, there‚Äôs a good chance I will lose over $300. 

Last thing: When you buy bitcoin, the price is always automatically inflated about 3% higher from what the graph represents. It won‚Äôt tell you the inflated price until after you select your payment method and amount, and then the price is magically higher. Conversely, the price deflates from the ‚Äúcurrent price‚Äù on the graph by about 3% every time you sell! Added up, that‚Äôs cutting into your profits by about 6%. Significant!!",1,1

I did that twice and after the third attempt was successful I found out that I now owned $1500 of Cardano and got hit with transaction fees that I should‚Äôve never been charged. An email from them was a general form email. It‚Äôs only about $30 but how often does this happen? I trade with TD Ameritrade and they compensate for their mistakes.
Nothing has been done. I received an email on September 7 that they closed my case. They also will not release the almost $500 that is in my cash account that has been on hold for nearly a week. Coinbase has handled this very unprofessionally for a publicly traded company.",1,1

Just logging in doesn‚Äôt work. Most of the time you will see an alert telling you to try again in a couple of hours. And that is before you give them any money and trust them with your bank details.

Also in your portfolio I would be nice to be shown the percentage of loss or gain and the amount in cash you gained but they don‚Äôt do that would be nice to add it.

If it tells you you have a certain amount available to transfer you don‚Äôt actually have that amount because they are going to charge you way more to transfer it. They also allowed me to send btc to an email that wasn‚Äôt even associated with Coinbase so now my money is just somewhere in limbo and they will not do anything about it.

For market orders, Coinbase, not Pro, is the most intuitive route.  Price alerts on either platform are severely lacking. Coinbase should merge the two apps and then toss them in the trash.

With the watching videos to earn crypto I felt like I clicked all the answers until I got it right‚Ä¶ and the big thing I don‚Äôt like is the company spends too much money on advertising. If the company is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù place to buy and sell crypto it doesn‚Äôt need advertising to help it grow. I think they should infuse their money elsewhere and reinvest it into the company such as better customer support and adding crypto futures just for an example.

2022-02-03,"Disclosure: I am new to this! 6 months in. I am just playing with small amounts here trying to learn. What I think I have learned so far‚Ä¶. Coinbase prices lag up to 15 minutes at times.

This is a big boy‚Äôs arena. Those of you who are struggling should stay out of this game.  Bring big money and think long term.

Easily gain a negative, lack of customer support assistance, worst software with little to none assistance. Bank verification is obsolete and bugged out, gdax is as bad as coinbase. Expect your funds to be put on hold due to their greediness to not respond to your information, not send a verification charge to your bank, and also make it so you can‚Äôt resend the verification, forcing you to go to gdax which wants a I.D verification that never works, same 2-4 week response time for customer service, and also the only response is from their automated robot chat that never knows anything more than 3 questions. Good luck, because there are better ways to earn your money.",1,1

I‚Äôve been buying crypto currency for almost one year and all the sudden my account gets hacked. I spend hours on the phone to clear everything up and got my account back too, which makes me even more annoyed now that I think about it.

2021-09-02,"Coinbase makes Crypto not only easier to understand but it makes it fun. They understand that Crypto is an enigma for most of us. Which makes it intimidating and, in turn, may force a lot of people away from it. Coinbase offers tiny tutorials on the industry to get the basics under control. They last a few minutes with a quiz question at the end. Get the question right and they give you anywhere from $1 to $3 worth of the Crypto-Currency that the tutorial covered. I‚Äôve made close to $100 worth of Crypto in this way and, more importantly, a somewhat workable knowledge of crypto. So, if you‚Äôre interested in this- Coinbase is the app to use.",5,4
2021-10-18,"I‚Äôve used their app since 2015. The wallet is decent. Sometimes you get locked out of your account and it will take 72+ hours to get back in. You learn to get through it.

The debit/credit card though‚Ä¶ Do not get one of these. I had a good chunk of money stolen. After 15 calls with the customer support team over a 3 month period, each time the service rep would state that I should have a response soon, I started emailing them and had to restart the process all over. Then it was 3 weeks of frustrating emailing still without any light of day!  

One of the biggest wastes of time I‚Äôve ever experienced. I encourage you to avoid the credit card as they do not have the resources, training, or systems in place to handle if/when your card number gets stolen.",2,1
2021-03-03,"Ask yourself one question..are you willing to risk all your money with people who don‚Äôt even care enough about you to take a phone call? There is no way to contact coinbase customer support except through email, and when you eventually do get an email, they won‚Äôt respond again to a reply. In other words, you cannot have a conversation with a coinbase representative. You have to submit a request for them to email you and they will send you one email regarding the issue. If, for whatever reason, they did not answer your question/issue in its entirety (as with my case), the only way to get another response is to submit another request for them to email you. As you can imagine, this can impair your ability to trade and fundamentally destroys any trust you have with the exchange. Why would you trust someone with your money if they are not willing to engage in a conversation with you?",1,1

The various menu screens often lead to dead ends that require you to take an action without telling you how or where to perform that action. The help menu is outdated and often simply wrong. More than once it gives the wrong instructions. The app is an enormous, non-ergonomic mess. You should already have experience with crypto trading BEFORE you use this or it could cost you. Other weird bugs crop up as well such as the app will suddenly change the brightness settings of your phone. One minute it‚Äôs blinding bright, next screen is unreadably dark. This isn‚Äôt just the app. If you go to your phone settings you‚Äôll find the brightness has been altered device-wide. Weird.",1,1

Edit: Reached out the Coinbase support after receiving a response from them on the App Store and they STILL have done nothing to help. They claimed my case was being reviewed, but my case was closed over a month despite not getting resolved. The customer service representative did not seem knowledgeable at all.

Most of the time, if a big price fluctuation happens you have no real time data to decide what the best play is. It‚Äôs almost like they hide the big market fluctuations by not letting you see them until they have dipped significantly. You can get real time price data on so many other platforms but for some reason the exchange with the biggest name and some of the craziest fees on the average consumer can‚Äôt provide that? I‚Äôve never written an app review in my life, but I think it‚Äôs essential to let people know that there are so many better options. The way I see Coinbase is that it might be helpful to a novice in the crypto space, but realistically it‚Äôs one of the worst options. Do yourself a favor and pick another one chief.",1,3
2021-04-14,App is really good learned a lot about crypto at a fast rate and my accounts already up to $55 by just investing 10 and watching their videos They paid me $36 just to learn about crypto which gave me a advantage over the market. Only thing I can say that I wish was added is the ability to trade crypto with currency‚Äôs not supported but shown on crypto some that are under a dollar a stock are usually unavailable. Great way to start investing in yourself though my strategy is to invest for the long run with currency‚Äôs worth less than a dollar and over a few years maybe a few will blow just like Bitcoin due to all the new use in technology,5,4
2021-05-14,"The app is very user friendly and of course coinbase charges their fee for any purchases. However the reason I‚Äôm giving this app a 1 star is because of the deceptive tactics coinbase uses in trading.

However I‚Äôve noticed that everyone I trade the amount trading over is $3 less that what it told me was being traded. So I‚Äôve I went to trade $100 of Bitcoin for something else I would only receive $97 of the other coin. And this has happen on EVERY one of them. 
Very dishonest to show that they are charging $0 when they are really scraping $3 off the top every time. 
Now I get it that not a lot of money however when I‚Äôm making small $100 trades that‚Äôs 3% of my money. Plus no matter how much it is the dishonesty behind it is what warrants the negative review.",1,1

Oh there was a 1 dollar fee for trans 100 bucks also. I got a note that said my LTC will appear in my wallet in 8 days also. Need to track fees cause it dose t show up after you enter. Maybe on the day of transaction? Very new to this and I've read the good and the bad reviews for this app. It dose seem easier than others I've looked at. Time will tell. I will update once this trade goes thru. Three stars because so far it's doing what it's supposed to but hasn't completed the entire process yet.,5,3
2019-04-07,"Firstly, as all have mentioned, the constant fees eat up your gains. Also I‚Äôm convinced they are siphoning feed on the ‚Äúfree‚Äù trades also, since after numerous trades my value would always decrease by ~$5 per transaction regardless of the direction either crypto was moving.

Now for the REALLY ugly: They blocked my trades when I tried to move to a different currency near the apex of a 2x surge. Ive also had it happen on smaller rising trends as well. Guess what...they ALSO blocked my trades on the down slope. So I was forced to ride it up and then back down, to 25% below what I started with.

Feels scammy. I‚Äôm going to cash out before they take all of my capital. All in all, after gaining about 20% on my capital in a few days, all but 1% which I get to keep is going to them due to fees. That‚Äôs right, 95% of all the headway I made watching and trading for hours went into their pockets and I was LUCKY to fold when I had an additional 1% to walk away with.",1,1

    The Coinbase network is unstable!  buy transactions take up to two weeks and 6 days to sell! This combined with the fees make this app a no go for me ever again.  
   the only thing good I can say is I‚Äôm glad that this got me into crypto currency. Other than that it was an over all thumbs down experience.

Update: If you take the time to look through the reviews something strange is happening. There are lots of 5 star reviews that are actually negative reviews. So either they (the reviewers) forgot to put the right star rating that actually reflects their reviews or someone is Messing with the ratings... I would be will to bet the average rating of this app is much lower if it was properly rated!",1,1
2017-10-13,"If you are considering investing in digital assets, such as bitcoin, start with this App.  Many good things to like here: Very easy to  start, invest, and share.

Coinbase is run by Brian Armstrong with funding from Digital Currency Group, run by Barry Silbert.  This is important because it's a wallet and you need to trust your provider.

The app is linked to a more full featured website.  Very easy to buy, sell, and send coin to friends.  Also, has a Vault feature which is used to store larger balances more cryptographically secure through multi-signature access provides much needed  sleep at night comfort.

The company has a history of making sound announcements; especially when volume spikes and trading is impossible globally...and this does happen.

They were also leaders during the Ethereum split and most recently during the birth of bitcoin cash.  

If you are going to start in crypto (wise move, early days) start here, go slow, learn and grow your portfolio.

When I sold I received a notification that it went through so I‚Äôm waiting to see usd in my wallet. Nothing showed for about 5 minutes and when it finally did it was my shares I had just tried to sell. However now the price had dropped 15%. Infuriated I quickly tried to sell again when a notification read ‚Äúdue to suspicious market activity coinbase has disabled transactions‚Äù no later than 5 minutes went by and it worked just fine but now I had lost 30%. I won‚Äôt name the crypto but it is supported and sold on coinbase. So you‚Äôre telling me when a stock goes up 50% in 24 hours you halt transactions?! Are you kidding me coinbase? Thanks for screwing me.,1,1
2021-09-21,"Overall Coinbase is an excellent app for all things cryptocurrency.  It‚Äôs interface is appealing to the eye.  The rewards feature is a great idea and a major reason I continue to use this app.  While I enjoy this app there are a few things I would like added to make the user experience better.

1. There‚Äôs no filter options for the crypto that you earn. (Amount of shares owned, total value of shares, total return on investment)

2. No ability to see the total gain or loss of individual cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs very annoying to have to look at each one to see how much I‚Äôve gained or lost by looking at the difference
Between the amount I spent and the value now.  I think that could be streamlined and it would benefit this app greatly.  I would like to see it almost copy Robinhoods design for their ‚ÄúInvesting‚Äù Tab.

3. I found it very weird that I was unable to find a feedback section on any Coinbase app or the website.  The App Store reviews aren‚Äôt the most intuitive way to receive or give feedback. 

Other than these annoying issues Coinbase is great.",4,4
2021-09-05,"I really like the user interface of the Coinbase app. It‚Äôs easy to use even for novices. My biggest complaint with this Coinbase is that there is no way to view our Profit/Losses and no way to view the average price paid per coin. This seems like a very much needed feature for a crypto exchange where the goal is to make profit. If this very basic feature was on this app I would give it five stars (and willing to change my review if corrected). Like any app from time to time it crashes but that‚Äôs pretty normal under high traffic times. Again, easy to use app that shows what coins are moving and has a ‚ÄúCoinbase Earn‚Äù feature where you can earn small amounts of crypto while watching short videos on a specific coin.",3,4

The company it was being transferred from did and they said it was on Coinbase side. It took them 7 months to get me back into my account. I don‚Äôt trust them anymore.

2021-06-10,"I‚Äôve been using Coinbase for the past 6 months, and recently I‚Äôve experienced some issues that are rather annoying. Though they‚Äôre not gamebreaking, I‚Äôm leaving a review in hopes that these hiccups will be addressed.

I had to sign in earlier this week, which was odd to me because after making my account initially I‚Äôve never had to sign in. I‚Äôm talking full sign in, not enter my PIN or use FACE ID‚Äîhowever, speaking of entering a PIN and FACE ID, I‚Äôm noticing now that when I boot up the app I‚Äôm prompted to enter my PIN, even though I have my settings to use my FACE ID instead. This features works when I switch back to Coinbase from another app, but it doesn‚Äôt work if I‚Äôm opening the app. That was never an issue prior to this week.

Please look into these bugs.",3,2

I DO NOT have recurring charges set up, there‚Äôs no history of me placing a recurring charge. I‚Äôve never gotten an answer on why/how this happened and they don‚Äôt respond when I show screenshots of the blank recurring charge history.

2018-01-06,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! DO NOT INVEST WITH COINBASE. I downloaded it because I wanted to buy Ripple and in order to do that I had to make those transfers from Coinbase but I should have kept looking. Coinbase has taken so much money from me in fees it's insane. In order to link my credit card I had to verify it and they charged me three times for the verification all charges were above $1 and they're no returning that money. I've heard of companies sending you money to verify but never taking away from your bank to verify. Another thing that's extremely upsetting is the fact that these idiots don't even have my bank so I can transfer my money back to my bank!? They don't have America first or Mount of America? So now I can't even transfer the money I have in my wallet to my account. They have fees to buy a crypto currency and a fee to transfer to wallet and another to transfer to bank!? These guys should not be 4 1/2 stars no way.,1,1

Update: the developer is asking me to reach out but that‚Äôs the exact same problem. You only get canned replies and nobody is looking into your account. I have even sent them proof from THEIR system that my account is fully verified and yet they don‚Äôt take the time to look into the issue.

I emailed support and all they did was send condescending information like the value of your assets fluctuate with financial markets. Like duh!!! That‚Äôs not what I was asking about. My total assets percentage wise only added up to 87%. There was a 13% difference between my balance and my actual total assets. I withdrew all my assets from Coinbase (meaning I have 0 value on Coinbase) yet my portfolio balance shows $38.

It feels as if coinbase will do everything in its power to make the money you put into it as inaccessible as possible. This largely comes from their document verification feature which requires proper id to buy or sell which on paper sounds like a reasonable feature to protect from fraud. However my dementia ridden half-blind grandmother could iD documents better than whatever they have currently. Which has lead me into endlessly resubmitting my very valid ID into the app just to be rejected and locked out of my account for 24 hours.

I have to scroll down a lot of currencies to find the ones I purchased, why isn‚Äôt portfolio tab more reflective of my actual portfolio / transactions history. Why can‚Äôt I edit/sort that list? Why do you show me currencies I don‚Äôt care about in my portfolio instead of the transaction history? Why are my investments hidden below the fold?

Why is the available balance missing in the purchase flow? 

Why can‚Äôt I sell cryptos to desired fiat currency? Why do you let change my currency settings to Euros but that the Sell flow remains is in USD?

2021-02-03,I don‚Äôt mean to judge but this app is supposed to be the premier safest and most secure way to really have anything to do with cryptocurrency. That being said the customer service robot and account customer service infinite lockout loop is especially a treat. Now let us look at the way the mobile tabs are presented. If I trade coins I can‚Äôt see the dollar amount of the previous coins in the history so I can‚Äôt tell if I gained. I don‚Äôt like how the timing is updated and I really don‚Äôt like the amount of data and information is collected and used. I say it‚Äôs shady because it acts that way I don‚Äôt care to prove anything but every trade seems scalped to loose instantly and although I am very happy with my investments and grateful for the rewards but could go without the buts this is the only app I use and have been burned on coins that are no longer supported or tradable.,2,3

You typically spend 1-5$ per transaction depending on how much you buy, however that may not seem like a lot but over time (like with their Recurring Purchases) you end up paying more than you'd like to.

2022-04-14,"Seriously flawed. I‚Äôm writing sideways.  It is hard to believe the founder of Coinbase, who‚Äôs suppose to be supremely tech savvy, would have such an antiquated app and interface. I‚Äôm typing sideways. The app was written for first generation smart phones, and the screen looks like such. It remains locked in a bulky, truncated portrait mode. You may not orient your device horizontally.   

The graphs are by far the worst I‚Äôve ever seen. There are zero units of measurement, neither on the vertical scale, nor the horizontal. Thus you can not visually gauge price vs. time.  You must go to another app to view graphs. 

That being said, the app is superb for educating neophytes on what‚Äôs out there, an excellent educational tool. 

One of the most egregious flaws is that you can‚Äôt read the transaction at the bottom of the screen because it‚Äôs blocked with a thick, opaque huge horizontal blue bar that says ‚ÄúTRADE‚Äù.  You cannot decline it, minimize it, or make it go away.  It completely covers your first trade, and you simply cannot view the transaction.  A can of bug spray should come with this app.

1). I like the simple charting interface to watch your portfolio grow. 
2). Offers a good amount of cryptocurrencies to buy.
3). Earn free crypto for learning about different cryptocurrencies. 
4). Instant buying power while funds settle. 

Cons:
1). The simple charting interface becomes WAY to simple! It would be nice to have pie charts or other graphs to track the growth of my investments next to my purchases. 
2). You can only place market orders, no limit orders. 
3). Zero charting besides a dull line graph. No candles, drawing, or any other tools. 
4). No crypto news section. 
5). Overall just too simple. 

To offset some of these cons I downloaded Coinbase Pro and moved all my funds over there. This was to be a mistake. It was overly complicated to move the funds and once they hit CBP, all my buying history was gone. Example: let‚Äôs say I had eight purchases of BTC of $25 each. Once transferred into CBP all of those instances became one deposit $200, which stinks. With CBP you get basic order book info and simple candle graphs but you lose all ability to track or chart your investments; ALL! Oddly enough the Pro version is even more plain GUI.

2017-12-27,"December 2017 ‚Äì update

With the cryptocraze boom over the last year, I‚Äôve noticed a marked change with Coinbase, unfortunately not for the better. Fees are ridiiiiiculously high when sending my BTC to another address, and it takes longer for transactions to go through. 

It‚Äôs not uncommon for the app to crash/not load/disable buys/sells during high traffic days when there‚Äôs a lot of movement in the market, which makes for a frustrating experience. 

January 2017 ‚Äì original review

Coinbase has come a long way since early 2014. After buying BTC and sending it to my old Hive wallet, and pretty much forgetting about it the past 3 years, I was alarmed to find out my old Hive wallet was no longer a thing (I don't recall keeping BTC in the same place where you bought them being proper back then). But now Coinbase is one of the most respected 1-stop shops for managing BTC. It took about 15min longer than the stated 30 for my BTC transfer to be confirmed, but the app is simple and beautiful to work with. Love the price alerts I can set up‚Äîjust a really attractive and functional interface. Well done!",4,3

Tiok well over a month of emails g to get it fixed (yes I tried all methods myself that at they kept repeating to me to try).  Then it wanted me to upload identification to verify identity.  I have tried many many times.  Either it gives me a protocol error, a server too busy error, or it successfully uploads and tells me that it's usually approved within 3-5 minutes.  Well... it's never approved for me.  It eventually seems to timeout... and revert back to the beginning and wants me to upload ID again.  I'm so over this.  And the value of Bitcoin, meanwhile... has gone from around 7,000 to around 17,000... while I've waited.  There must be an alternative company that had their act more together.",1,1

2018-04-17,"***Note to all users: AVOID transferring money between digital wallets within Coinbase, it is a trap and your money will end up ‚Äúin the cloud‚Äù as customer service liked to call it.

First off I‚Äôd like to say that coin base is an excellent platform for beginners that would like to invest their money into digital Currencies. Simple, easy to use and the customer service is friendly:)

With that being said, the reason for the 1star review is because I lost a fair amount of money for transferring funds from my litecoin digital wallet to my bitcoin digital wallet.

HERE‚ÄôS ALL I DID: Using the url given to my account SPECIFICALLY for my bitcoin digital wallet, I sent money from my litecoin wallet to that address. Few moments later, the transaction status said complete... Although there was no money that ended up in my bitcoin wallet, but of course the money was taken from my litecoin wallet.

I spoke with customer service and her explanation for what happened was that the money just ended up in the cloud and that there was nothing I could do, the money was lost.

So pretty much that method of transferring funds is a trap to take your money with no reimbursement. 

I hope this advice gets to you guys well, as I‚Äôd like to prevent this trickery from happening to anyone else.",1,1

They cant even give correct instructions on their own app telling me to click somewhere and it does not even exist (accounts tab in settings). I then tell them i cannot add bank and the foreign support tells me to delete the bank account. How can i delete it if i cannot add it and thats the whole point im contacting you. The same problem prevented me from withdrawing cash. Eventually transferred the case to email support and they supposedly ‚Äúfixed‚Äù the problem and i go on to check and the issue was not fixed.

Then the coin you want to convert it in to will be overvalued (let‚Äôs say Chainlink is currently at $30, they buy in at $33) they will then buy you into your conversion coin way over the value it is currently trading. Did this with BNT, I had $1540 sitting in USDC, I went to convert that in to BNT for its current price of $5.96 and it bought me in at a price of $6.90 almost a dollar higher than its current value.

The new chart graphics look stupid. I quite liked the old ones. The new charts are probably the worst charts I have ever seen anywhere, ever. Plus, I‚Äôm pretty sure they are not even accurate and up to date now. The percentage change no longer represents the actual price movement and could now say up when the price is actually down.

The market up/down percentage no longer works. The market will be down on everything and it says the market is up, or visa-versa. 

Oh and I just noticed that if you go to the top gainers list it doesn‚Äôt list the gainers in order, and actually also sprinkles losers in with the gainers. Basically the top gainers list is now just a bunch of random coins that could be either up or down. 

This has really just become an absolutely dumb app to interact with or even have to look at.

I swear, it won‚Äôt let me buy with my own money that‚Äôs been on the app for weeks and weeks. Ridiculous. Makes me genuinely want to scream sometimes how frustrating the bugs are and ONLY happen I swear on everything when the crypto market is in a dip.",5,1
2023-05-17,"I like how easy it is to purchase assets on the app. However, they make it very difficult to track how your investment is doing. I even messaged with a support person who couldn‚Äôt communicate to me how I can see the average cost of my purchases so I can se my overall P&L. Not a very intuitive app for anything other than buying more crypto, but I guess that‚Äôs where they make their money.

Update. I looked at the note the developer sent about the tax settings. I‚Äôve done this before and understand it‚Äôs use. However, this doesn‚Äôt bring back the view we had literally a week or so ago that shows me a consolidated view of my all time +- for the account and each asset. I just want that feature back. Changing my review to 1 since they don‚Äôt seem to be able to give me a work around to that.",1,2
2019-06-20,99cents to buy and 1.99 to sell I feel like is a little ridiculous that‚Äôs 3$ of our money to possibly have our coin profit I mean if the profits are in the thousands then I guess it is ok another thing not able to Withdrawal my money that has been taking out of my account already with a notification saying money hasn‚Äôt settled yet but is out of my bank is almost me bribing this rating to 2 star they need to fix that ASAP a lot of people will not like that as I don‚Äôt if the money is lit of our account and you got your fees paid out money should be able to do whatever so we like FIX IT.,5,2
2021-12-31,"First off, you are much better off using any other crypto platform rather than Coinbase. They have a trend of locking/disabling accounts that send crypto to institutions/addresses they don‚Äôt like (can be anything from foreign products to your friends wallet), secondly, they (like Robinhood), restrict access to the site during times of massive fluctuations (that people typically bet on and profit off), causing thousands of dollars of losses (most recent example is GYEN coin). I have used this platform loyally for years, however after an number of ‚Äúinfo verification requirements‚Äù my account has been locked numerous times (I ONLY use Coinbase for investing/purchasing). Customer service is a joke with even the simplest of questions taking a month or longer to answer. GO ELSEWHERE. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE AVERAGE REVIEW LEVEL. YOU WILL GET SCREWED OVER IT IS AN EVENTUALITY WITH THIS PLATFORM",1,1
2021-06-24,"So for one, they revoked my buying privileges  because my bank (at the time) denied cryptocurrency purchases so it denied a bank transfer. I‚Äôve since switched banks and Coinbase says my buying privileges have been revoked permanently, they‚Äôre not going to give me a reason, and that there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it.
For two, I finally got accepted into the crypto earn thing after being on the waitlist for 2 years. I can‚Äôt answer their questions because I get an error saying ‚Äúthere‚Äôs been an error, please try again later‚Äù but it‚Äôs always the same. Try to connect with support, and I get an email saying there is no support but to follow their troubleshoots. Are you kidding? I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Coinbase to anyone, they‚Äôre catty and then being the biggest exchange with no support is just ridiculous.",1,2

There‚Äôs soooo many options now. Coinbase has first movers advantage and they literally screwed it up üòÇ hopefully they don‚Äôt hit and bury this review (they will) and I can save a lot of you the trouble of the inevitable day you need this non existent, bot-ran support system that has literally never been useful to me in 2+ years (to my dismay) of using the platform.",4,1
2018-10-08,Coinbase is one of the most user friendly platforms but also is very limited on what coins are available for purchase.  Some of the most prominent coins with the largest communities such as XRP or TRX aren‚Äôt even listed.  Besides that 100 dollar limit on spending a week on debit card for instant payment is nothing in an investing standpoint.  Yes you can use a bank transfer which would allow you spend more but it takes two weeks for the money to clear.  If some changes would be made to these issues Coinbase would hands down be the best platform out there.,5,2
2018-11-14,"UPDATE: Came back to Coinbase just to see if they got better. The fees are still outrageous and then I was charged international transaction fees by my bank too, that's new!!!!!! A $40 bitcoin buy and transfer ended up costing me $45 after the $2 Coinbase and other transaction fees. Coinbase charges you $2 to buy whether you're getting $5 or $100. Again, I'm just gonna stick with Square. It's free to buy, send and receive. 

This used to be my go to app for bitcoin trading. But after a situation where an ACH deposit took over two weeks to arrive in my account..... it‚Äôs not practical for those who want to trade instantly. By the time the money got to my account, I had already started and transferred to a new Square Cash wallet in minutes! Coinbase Fees are extremely high and there‚Äôs no point now when apps like Square Cash and Robinhood will let you buy/trade FOR FREE!",1,1

This should not happen, especially without a reason. They literally just blocked off all access to my account, from my phone and everything else.

No wonder there stock is crashing hard since everyone is watching them scheming crypto buyers. So it‚Äôs been a while since this post, nothing has changed too bad I can post pictures but for reals I this company is stealing from us, no wonder the stock and investors are driving it down. Fixes are needed for this but as of today is a steal",1,1
2020-05-10,This application would be great if they had any type of customer service. I had an issue where a purchase was reversed due to a minor banking issue. When I tried to fix the issue the application would not let me so I tried to call customer service to get help and they automatically locked my account. Do not try calling the customer service number or they will lock your account. There is nobody available to call and emails take hours to get replies which do not fix my simple issue. I need the account unlocked and I need the application to allow me to add a funding source. This is taking 2 to 3 days to fix if at all. For the size of this company they should upgrade their non existent customer service deportment. Use this application very carefully and don‚Äôt expect any help if you have a problem.,1,1
2019-09-23,I‚Äôve been dealing with a customer support issue for 5 weeks now that it‚Äôs still unsolved.  Coinbase systems will remove my card unannounced saying it was a ‚Äúbank problem‚Äù I called my bank and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with my card there removing it for no reason!!!  I start working with the management team for the payment after there associates couldn‚Äôt help me and there just as bad.  Louis Jacob and Tristian are all horrible managers there.  Jacob and Tristian rudely hung up on me without a reason.  And still dealing with this issue Louis has the audacity to tell me that my account had been resolved and I‚Äôm in the wrong when the idiots at the account specialist team didn‚Äôt answer my question.

If just starting out, use this app. You will venture into other apps eventually and different places to store coins but start here. Coinbase has NEVER been hacked, yet, its best to keep large amounts of funds in ""cold storage"". Look up Canton Becker and paper wallet storage for large amounts. But Coinbase is great. Yes there are fees for buying and selling but that's capitalism. Yes you will probably pay small ""international"" charges through your bank. THIS is why we support new currencies. Invest and hold.

2017-12-28,"I used coinbase to buy my very first bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, and now bitcoin cash. The process was SUPER easy. I had never dealt with cryptos before, so I needed a ""for dummies"" kind of app. This was a perfect starter, and is also a wallet, which made it really easy for me to buy and store my coinage. I have noticed that there is a lot of down-time, especially when pricing has huge fluctuations. And the fees charged on transactions are a bit steep, but for someone that's just beginning, I'm not going to let it upset me. My one request: PLEASE ADD RIPPLE (XRP.) My ripple is sitting on an exchange site, and I'd like to have everything in one place in coinbase. Plus, buying more ripple would be an awesome feature because it's gaining momentum.",4,4
2021-03-14,"I highly recommend Coinbase to anyone who wants to buy into the crypto market. It is gaining momentum at a rapid pace and you don‚Äôt want to be caught in last place. They even pay you in different coins  and all you have to do is let them teaches you about them. Easy money and you get an education. What more could you ask for? So hurry up and check them out. You‚Äôll only be doing yourself a favor. If you‚Äôre still not sure, maybe jump online to check out a few videos to warm you up. Cheers!",5,5
2022-02-15,"Ok let me start of by saying the app is great, very user friendly and easy to maneuver. My gripe is in the fees, i know Coinbase needs to keep the lights on and fill their pockets (as well as deal out crypto through their learn & earn program üëç good job there), but man‚Ä¶ there are fees out the wazzoo. They aren‚Äôt massive fees, but the frequency of them adds up. Im sure there‚Äôs better ways to operate the app to dig around those fees that im not doing, but thats just my personal experience. I recommend if you‚Äôre looking to set up reoccurring crypto investments because i dont think the fees apply there, but if you play the game and trade often those fees can get crazy. All in all I didn‚Äôt lose any money üëç just a little profit.",3,3
2022-02-14,"Cannot stand the delay on iPhone 13 Pro Max‚Ä¶ everything is delayed that you click on, servers are overwhelmed with requests. App interface is sluggish at best on current gen hardware. App harmonization is terrible. Honestly, I find it challenging to even agree that the content is well organized. You got multiple places to find similar but not identical data. Top gainers can be extremely misleading without a delineated time frame explicitly mentioned. You need a separate app to do your research before proceeding with ‚Äúinformed transactions‚Äù to be fair. This app, looks popular but runs like some Google Play store overlay from India‚Ä¶.there‚Äôs way better stuff out there to do your crypto trading on.

Locked down my account and reactivated it and found out $1K was lost without a legit explanation from Coinbase customer support. Emailed Coinbase support team multiple times about unauthorized transactions but customer support did nothing for my case report except that they are investigating it and emailing generic responses one after another. Just told me to reset my password and report to law enforcement. Every time you buy or sell a crypto, it cost a fee. Robinhood or other trading platforms are much better. This is ridiculous customer support and sketchy trading platform, don‚Äôt know where the high reviews are coming from. This app doesn‚Äôt deserve even a 1 star rating but -5 stars rating!!!",1,1

Not only are their fees high, they are making money when you sell. Check the  price before you sell because these guys are stealing from its customers on the way in and on the way out. I would recommend you purchase elsewhere unless you like your money taken away. So save yourself the headache. I will be making it known on social media with proof. Believe me, I will be heard.",1,1
2021-10-28,I recently bought some bitcoin with a friend that was in the crypto currency market. I needed the bitcoin to use it for a broker to start making some extra money but for some reason Coinbase decided to make my funds unavailable for 8 days. I tried contacting the support team via email but they did not give me a reason as to why I could not use my fund as soon as I bought them. Right now they are sitting in my wallet with no use because it won‚Äôt even let me cash out but my friend bought some and got his fund almost immidiately. Coinbase took my money and did not give me the cryptos in return. I also tried trust wallet and they gave me the funds almost immediately so if you are looking for a safe option I suggest you go with Coinbase because it does not work for everyone.,1,1
2021-06-23,"Let me skip to the biggest concern I had after reading so many reviews: withdrawing funds. I had read of people that were left unable to move money back into their bank so I tested it out with a small sum. The first few tries DID cancel themselves. The third time I tried withdrawing to my bank account and it worked right away.
Also afterward I realized it initially failed because the debit card on file was expired so no fault of coin base.
And speaking to their customer service I have contacted them several times and each time was prompt and helpful.",5,1
2020-12-29,"The good: Coinbase is a pretty sleek app. There‚Äôs great features like the ‚Äúvault‚Äù that is a solid theft prevention tool for your funds.
The bad: Unfortunately, the fees on Coinbase are very very high. There‚Äôs fees for converting your cryptocurrency and fees for selling your cryptocurrency. It really digs into your profits. Also a huge issue I‚Äôve found is that when you buy or sell a cryptocurrency you often buy at the highest price, and sell at the lowest price. If a stock that is currently trading at .60 cents but was .74 cents 20 minutes ago you will pay .74 cents it seems. I used this app for a week and then took my money out. The fees and lack of updated market info really dissuaded me. Coinbase Pro is a far better option, even that has some fees compared to competitors.",3,2
2020-11-29,"Terrible. I used coinbase for years. During the last Bitcoin surge, coinbase completely crashed. I couldn‚Äôt log on for hours. Once I was able to log on, I missed the right moment to sell. I sold at the moment I was back in, however, my sale canceled. 

To make matters worst. All of my funds disappeared, completely gone as if they never existed. After trying to contact support for two day with no response, my funds finally appeared, and the sale did not go thru, making me miss another crucial moments and profit. 

   How can a platform charge so much money for incredibly terrible service. Will take all of my money out and move to Etoro or another platform.I will never use coinbase again, and recommend other to do the same. If they want to charge so much for transaction then they should make a functioning platform.",1,1

Right now it does not have potential on this time. The way I see this potential will grow will be in the future. So whoever is going to read my comment here, I gave you warning.

2018-06-15,"Coin base is a trustworthy and solid platform. It‚Äôs one of the few places you can turn fiat into a crypto asset. 

However, they only support 4 different assets. In a landscape the changes almost daily, they seem to have stalled a long time ago. If you were looking at the crypto market and exchanges as features, this one is very feature poor. Like a computer I can only send email, but not browse the web or anything else. They don‚Äôt support Ethereum tokens, or the majority of the top 10 assets in the world. In order to exchange and hold any other assets, have to move your assets to another exchange and hold them there, or in your own wallet. I have a feeling they will soon disappear for lack of support in this market. Evolve, or wither away",3,3

Somehow I got past that screen and tried to add my card information to at least start investing but it couldn‚Äôt do that either.  Site is an absolute waste of time.  I wish apps like this would let you know if they will not connect with your bank so you don‚Äôt waste your time and effort trying, not to mention giving them all your information up to that point which I‚Äôm sure they sell just like every other company or app out there.

1.Debit card only works at certain vendors and you wont know till you try to use it
2.Often you get insufficient fund notifications when trying to add cash from a bank even when your bank account has more then sufficient funds
3.Often your bank account will get tapped for the amount you tried to transfer to Coinbase only for it to be cancelled and returned days later.
4. Customer support will never help you, they will always pass you along to someone else or disconnect you all together, deliberately. 
5. There is No Manger ever to talk to. 
6. You cant get a complaint through, the agents just give you a run around.

2017-09-18,"All in all, I love Coinbase.  Great app, user friendly, seems very secure.  Only big issue is they don't allow larger purchases OR SELLING of bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin.  If I want to purchase OR SELL 20K-50K of bitcoin in one day or even one week, I can't do it...I'm capped at 15K/week.  So those features have to be improved if they want to compete with all the new wallet sites coming out.  

And their fees are WAY TOO HIGH.  I love the app but they HAVE to resolve these issues.  

And they need more people who can assist people over the phone.  Very irritating to have to wait days for someone to email me back.  But I do really like the app",5,4
2017-12-15,I would put zero stars if I was able to this thing is a total rip off heard good things about it from a friend then I downloaded it invested $20 and then it charged my card $10 of small fees in small amounts and wouldn‚Äôt stop it charged me 5 times literally I was like what the heck so I tried to sell and just uninstall the app and it wouldn‚Äôt give me back whatever I had left from the $20 that I had lost from the decrease in bitcoin that day tried contacting customer support they just have a dumb automatic computer thing finally found a contact number on google and was on hold for an hour and a half and they still said they had me on hold RIDICULOUS. Finally found out a way to get my money back again charge me all kinds of fees and it still doesn‚Äôt show in my account that the money was deposited I STRONGLY RECOMMEND DO NOT GET THIS APP !,1,1
2017-11-21,Only issues I have is when you want to get on Coinbase and it is crashing and you have no access.  Usually this is during big crashes or spikes when you most want to buy it or sell it.  Also my fiance has been unable to sell money at all because it is telling him to verify another for of identity.  (He has bought and sold before so it‚Äôs just now asking for another for some reason). He provided another form and it is not processing or accepting-  it‚Äôs been going on over a week.  He read online this has locked up some peoples accounts for months.  Hopefully he has access soon because we are trying to sell his funds to pay for our wedding and honeymoon.,3,2

Continue your internet highway robbery and y‚Äôall will only be a place for investors not regular everyday customers who are trying to purchase products, which the irony is the more we use your BTC service the more money you make and we spend.

2021-10-21,"Coinbase does NOT let you ‚Äúexplore‚Äù the world of Defi. They hand pick a bunch of coins and tokens and decide you can buy/sell to/from Coinbase at a freakishly huge fee (although other brokers charge high fees too). 

On Coinbase, you get real crypto- not like on robinhood or SoFi, but remember that nobody should ever ever ever keep their crypto on any exchange or hot wallet. Sure, Coinbase has good security they say, but keeping crypto in Coinbase or Coinbase wallet is extremely stupid and will be very sad when it disappears. 

Everyone should have Coinbase but use it for as few transactions as possible and keep your crypto in an air-gapped hardware wallet. The big institutions (such as Coinbase) don‚Äôt want you to use truly safe cold storage because then they can‚Äôt enjoy all the custodial perks. 

There is one very good thing about Coinbase: the debit card. It should be used as little as possible (enormous transaction fees), but it is the only way you can get instant spending power or paper cash from your crypto rather than having to wait for the clearing periods between banks.",3,2
2021-05-29,The description says if you have problems you can contact support. Well that‚Äôs a lie. The only support offered is for security if you want to lock the account or if you have coin base card with them. There is no link anywhere on the website that allows people to contact them if your issue is not in their database and/or their recommendation does not work. So be careful. I surely would not want to have any money tied up with a company that does not at least have email support and I can‚Äôt imagine the problems that would come if someone did have a lot of money in their accounts with no one to speak too. Very shady if you ask me. I see some people saying they could email the company. Can someone tell me what that email is? I can‚Äôt find a link anywhere within the site.,1,1
2021-05-19,"Inasmuch as coin base solicits zero fees for exchanges between cryptocurrencies, they will take between 2% and 5% of your total balance under the guise of ‚Äútiming‚Äù for each and every conversion. It is statistically impossible to lose that much money on EVERY conversion/transaction in a 5‚Äì10 second span of time that it takes to make the conversion/transaction. Coinbase understates the value of a crypto when you own shares. Then, they overstate the value of a crypto when you do not own it. So, when you purchase/trade with an undervalued crypto to purchase in overvalued crypto, you are losing a lot of money! This is like Joe Byedumb claiming that he is not going to raise taxes and then turns around and spends trillions of dollars to stimulate inflation! Inflation is legalized theft and a tax! It devalues your spending power under the guise of ‚Äúlower taxes‚Äù! AVOID COINBASE! THEY ARE THIEVES!",1,1

Now I‚Äôm staring at a potential profit and can‚Äôt touch it. I‚Äôm trying to find another platform to move it and so far it is proving difficult. 
 Also the ‚Äúrewards‚Äù they offer are trash. Every time I try to claim them, whether it be in app or online, I get caught in a never ending cycle of error messages or loading screens.

Also noticed multiple glitches while attempting to set up the account, such as while trying to select what money I was trying to invest the saving button was in clickable due to the screen auto scrolling to the top.

Definitely recommend.",5,5

Today I finally was able to fund my wallet with LRC and after the transaction went through I got an error message. I try the transaction again and now have twice the amount I wanted to purchase. Then when I chatted with support, not only did I have to wait 20 minutes for them to misunderstand my issue, but when they told me my options for how to proceed, I got ANOTHER ERROR MESSAGE that signed me out and kicked me from the support convo before I could even read what they said.

This happens so much that I would not recommend for day trading but for long term investing. 3rd is today the app finally did me completely wrong by having my funds withdrawn to my bank card and my bank card has not received the money instantly as usual.

One last thing, if you call you‚Äôll be on hold for a very long time, I never got a chance to speak with a rep.

Even their contact us support form doesn‚Äôt work properly. It‚Äôs seriously nothing but amateur hour and headaches when dealing with Coinbase I would give zero stars if I could. If you are just getting into crypto stay far away from Coinbase they will scam you before you even know what happened",1,1

Then its Gandalf who says You Shall Not Sell until you give us some of your risks. I get the fees but offering and waiting for the light to turn blue meaning whoever set this up is very smart and greedy. I love  the way you guys work.  My risk is rewarded when I win. But I lose too but you guys take no part in that only if I eat I got to deal with the mooch. Happy Holidays. God Bkess,3,4

Even after doing all the research on the app, it was a waste of time and more importantly money. This app is here to make money, and that‚Äôs not a problem, I imagine they have to maintain the servers it takes to run all this programs, yet every thing you do from start to finish will have a charge on it, from buying stocks, to selling them, and also when you cash out, they make fees for every move you make, so they always make money, from the moment you put money into the account until the moment you leave the app. The best part is when the fees says $0.55 to cash out, and when you hit cash out it goes up to $1.78 for no reason.

2021-07-05,Using now for about 3 months. My first and biggest issue is that there is no clear way to see how much you‚Äôve made or how much you‚Äôve lost on each crypto you own. Only way I can do this is figure out how much I bought compared to the current price. Other big issue is with the portfolio view. You can see your total worth there but does not tell you how much you are up or down. Biggest issue with the portfolio view is that it only works 50% of the time. When it is not working all I see is a sine wave graphic with a $0 balance. Lastly it looks like I am paying about 2-3% on every transaction. Surely there can be another way to make money off of me without the gigantic fee.,2,2
2021-02-04,This app is a scam. For most people you‚Äôll be investing in something you have no clue about and hoping it‚Äôll work. But if you‚Äôre like me and able to make a few hundred off it in a short time Coinbase penalizes you. The stocks that start to go well will lose support from Coinbase and you‚Äôll lose your shares or they exchange it to a less valuable coin. Basically they‚Äôre gimping you when there‚Äôs a chance of success. On top of that when you want your money you‚Äôll have to wait for it to be an ‚Äúavailable balance‚Äù which can take up to 7 days. Imagine waiting a week to access the money you earned from the stock market. Highly recommend boycotting this brand they‚Äôre just as deceitful as Robinhood. Do yourself a favor and get Binance or Kraken. I cannot stress enough how terrible my experience has been trading with Coinbase.,1,1
2019-08-06,Deposited here for many years and then I made a big deposit and got this wallet setup for my bitcoin IRA.  After doing so they closed my account and didn‚Äôt even say why and won‚Äôt say.  I cannot access my account and I also have affiliate payments being made to their addresses. I can update my bitcoin IRA fortunately but any affiliate payments being made will be made to their address and I cannot update the payment account. So it really stinks to have been loyal for more than 5 years to Coinbase they do me so dirty.  It‚Äôs how I typically sell my bitcoin due to PayPal so I really regret setting up with coinbase. They are thieves and have stolen so much crypto from their customers. Really people if you don‚Äôt believe me check out coinbase on BBB or any complaints website and you will see how dirty they have been,2,1
2018-05-29,Beware. This company will put holds on your ability to withdraw or transfer your bitcoins for no reason. My purchase through Coinbase went through without incident - the money left my bank account and Coinbase acknowledged that to be true. The website says that with bank transfers the bitcoins are available to withdraw or transfer in 3-5 days. 2 weeks later they are saying that due to improvements being made to their service that my ability to withdraw or transfer is on hold for another 2 weeks. This is fraudulent and the purpose is for Coinbase to steal your money. They will charge you above market for your bitcoins then wait as the value drops to release your funds. Steer clear of this company and at the very least do some research. There is a reason they have an F rating with the better business bureau.,1,1
2022-08-08,"I like the app and it works very well. I‚Äôve had several little gripes in the last few months, but only one I can remember right now.

I keep having orders go through and I‚Äôm struggling to figure out which one went through.

Although I had to confirm my ID with pictures and stuff, yes that was done but I don‚Äôt want my identity out there for many reasons. Plus side, this app is very user friendly and has the social networking of Facebook to help learn more about it. 2 stars but I would say there is more cons than pros unfortunately.",2,2
2022-11-06,"I spent $60 to do a single swap when it showed the transaction costing $0. They will absolutely steal your money by giving a bad a spread price. Do not use their service.

They will also claim that ""slippage"" is responsible for such a ludicrous fee, even though coinbase, like most other brokerages, takes advantage of something called ""internalization"", this practice is when a brokerage keeps a large amount of securities or crypto on their books in order to facilitate trading and guarantee liquidity. In other words, when you buy on coinbase, you are not buying on the open market, youre borrowing fully fungible liquidity from their own hot wallet. Slippage doesnt apply when you arent using a decentralized liquidity pool. Again. Dont use their service.",1,1

When Robinhood opens up more crypto options and wallets, CB will lose me as a customer if this hasn‚Äôt been added. I do understand that crypto fees are a bit of a necessary evil, but to have to juggle two Apps (CB and CB Pro) in order to get lower transaction fees is beyond stupid.

2017-12-22,"Review #1: Coinbase (App)
Pros: Great UI, smooth even though what I would imagine would be times of heavy traffic
Cons: Data Between the app and the desktop site seem inconsistent, almost as if they run off of two different databases, which can be frustrating, especially for newcomers doing ID verification, etc. Veteran users might not experience any issue at all.

Review #2: Coinbase (Company)
Pros: Y‚Äôall are a bastion for U.S. cryptocurrency consumers trying to get some honest coin. Other bigwigs in the industry dropped us folks from their list of priorities :(
Keep fighting the good fight!
Cons: Hire more people. Seriously. I know you‚Äôre already on it, and I know it‚Äôs tough, but it can‚Äôt come soon enough. I‚Äôm sure this will help improve your ID verification processes, etc. and if it doesn‚Äôt: please work to improve it.

2021-10-19,"Incredibly high fees to purchase crypto.  $1.99 to purchase $30 of Bitcoin. And then you have to pay the same high fee to sell it.  No free withdrawals (other exchanges give you from 1 to 10 free withdraws a month).  No incentives to HODL. 

The Coinbase card is very limited. If you think you are getting something comparable to your bank card you will be disappointed.  It‚Äôs a pain to load money on it as it more often than not it tells you your loading source has insufficient funds when you have plenty of funds in your bank account.

2017-12-27,"1. Their updates are NOT on time; you‚Äôll lose money without even thinking of it, and you‚Äôll be behind on actual price changes.

2. Their alerts don‚Äôt even alert you via notifications. I have 4 separate alerts on LiteCoin alone, and none of them sent me a notification when triggered... you‚Äôll lose opportunities to make money with this alone.

3. Their support system is shady and unreliable. They use a Auto-Response Robot to try and help you out, and if that doesn‚Äôt work (which is the case), they send you a like to ‚ÄúContact Them,‚Äù only to be sent to a page that essentially says that we are only helping people with compromised account and lost passwords, everything else is irrelevant. So forget about being able to ask a human for help, and the fact that they‚Äôre having so many issues with compromised accounts alone definitely says something.

Don‚Äôt waste your time and/or your money with this app. Now that everyone and their mom is going into Cryptos, I‚Äôm sure there are other apps that are MUCH better and cleaner than this. I could‚Äôve made $50 today if ONLY the alert system worked; learn from my experience and look elsewhere for a crypto-trading app.",1,1
2022-12-18,"When I first started using this platform, which has been a little bit, I struggled a little with executing basic functions. Coinbase keeps improving the app and it's basically so easy to use now! If only we could work on fees!!!!! But in fairness I think they are in the ballpark. I have family on the other side of the world and this makes it real easy to send $ to my grandchildren for birthdays and such!! Thanks guys. 

PS. I certainly hope we can keep the federal government out. It's a good platform but government control is gonna F it up.",5,4
2023-02-02,"DO NOT USE!!! 

 I‚Äôve had a suspicion coinbase does ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù or otherwise keeps you from access during heavy market movement when spike or surges happen. 

 Sure enough, matic jumped over 25% today and coinbase keeps looping me through the login process so I can‚Äôt access or trade. 

I open the app, go to login screen. You go to login, it does email/password/text verification then directs you back to the app‚Ä¶ that stays on the same login screen.

Possible issue with phone? I thought of that too and tried opening in chrome on laptop. The app ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt recognize the device‚Äù (which it NEVER does because I use an f‚Äôing vpn) so I verify through my gmail. Coinbase conveniently leave out part of that is verifying that access‚Ä¶ THROUGH THE APP YOU CANNOT LOG INTO!!!

They do this on purpose. If you encounter this, pull phone logs to show the condition with date/time and speak to an attorney about fraud/insider trading from a broker. Also report them to the FTC.

They did this same crap in 2021 when doge and Shibu went nuts. Collect device logs for each occurrence and build evidence this only happens during heavy price movement of your assets.

I can‚Äôt wait to sue these POSs.",1,1

I really hate seeing money sitting in my platforms waiting for the number to hit that excites me. I don‚Äôt have to do that with Coinbase. It will front me up to $35,000. So when I see a number that gives me the chills I can say ‚Äúbuy my $50 of Doge and wala it‚Äôs done. No this is not a paid review. Thank you Coinbase for making my life easier.

2022-07-16,"Terrible security protocols and customer service. Had an unauthorized password change to my account. I immediately called and locked my account. However, the hacker (who had logged on from the other side of the country) still had time to make a $1000 BTC purchase, convert 7 of my other coins to BTC, then transfer it coinbase pro and then to god knows where.  

Customer service says there is nothing that can be done. This was my fault as I‚Äôm responsible for my own password. I get that. But I called to lock my account immediately (being responsible for my password) and all the disputed transactions occurred after my request. 

Use at your own risk and DO NOT leave your crypto on this app! You have zero protection if anything happens.  Very disappointed",1,1
2022-02-18,So yes I responded to your Super Bowl ad and tried to sign up taking a vantage of the $15 offer. Course they have said it was too busy and I cannot sign up yet I would send me an email to do it later. Tried to do it a few days later and the offer has been removed. Only offers $5 now. Doesn‚Äôt really matter if you had it in the terms that you could change the offer at any time. Offering something that cannot be redeemed immediately and then taking it away is a clear-cut case of bait and switch. What a horrible business practice and crappy thing to do to potential new customers. You‚Äôre trying to start a trusting financial relationship with new customers by Miss handling money and your promise. Wow what a horrible marketing decision.,1,1
2021-10-27,"I‚Äôve been using this app for a few months now.  This app is very unreliable,  tons of users lost a lot of money, only as a result of Coinbase not allowing users to buy or sell tokens at a critical moment, this is happening again, all day 10/27 with SHIB as I type this review. Unfortunately the users are the ones, who are  literally paying the price whenever this happens. This is unacceptable specially when Coinbase takes a percentage of every transaction made using their platform. As a result of all the money i lost or didn‚Äôt make due to this app‚Äôs performance and reliability issue; I would not recommend this app.",3,1

The real issue, though, has been sending crypto to another address. Coinbase charges fees similar‚Äîbut in truth similar but still HIGHER‚Äîto competitors, but 4 times this month I have had transactions that have taken more than 4 hours to complete. All four have been through coinbase. I don‚Äôt believe any of the other apps has eclipsed the 5-minute window. If things weren‚Äôt time sensitive, I wouldn‚Äôt be dealing with crypto.

Customer service don‚Äôt care and don‚Äôt have the capability to to fix it they say.  And they restricted my wife‚Äôs account as well even though her ID is valid just because we are connected.   Horrible customer service.   I would rate them a zero if it was able.   Done this to a friend of mine as well.  They don‚Äôt  accept valid retired military IDs either.

I wish I would have just stuck with Robinhood even though they are being dragged through the mud they aren‚Äôt taking a big chunk of every transactions into and out of their platform. Advertised to seem like most services are free but not the case. I just hope nothing I have in Coinbase skyrockets I dont wanna see that fee when I want to pull out a decent chunk of money.

I sent a screenshot from the app to prove my account. Then I got an auto reply that my question was being transferred to a specialist. Over SIX weeks later, I got a generic email about troubleshooting such as updating the app. I was so frustrated that I went in to cancel my account only to find there is no ‚Äòclose account‚Äô option.

2021-02-06,"You would think when converting on Coinbase from one crypto to another that it is a 1:1 ratio. That couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. I literally lost $200 in 2 transactions, not because I did it wrong but the exchange rate was different. The amount of $ that it said I was converting was a few cents less than what I had which seemed reasonable. Then with one click of the button $200 gone and not coming back. 

So I tested this woth $5 and converted multiple ‚Äútradeable‚Äù stocks and in 3 trades o went from $5-$3. That is a 40% loss of my money for converting with a ‚Äú0%‚Äù fee!

Pretty sure this is a scam site as of now. I don‚Äôt know if it actually had anything to do with the covid pandemic, but that‚Äôs when my account was suddenly inaccessible- about a week ago to date.

2020-12-27,I highly recommend purchasing all your crypto currency's on Coinbase. First and foremost their security measures are very very good and thats very important especially when investing in Cryptos you want your money to be safe and Coinbase‚Äôs protocols keep your money safe more so than other crypto exchanges that can get easily hacked. I enjoy their quizzes and the awards they give you upon finishing the quizzes. I am also looking forward to the Coinbase debit card that allows you to purchase goods using crypto currency‚Äôs very exciting!!! In conclusion there is no other crypto currency broker I would use other than Coinbase they rock!!,5,5

Reasons I would change Rating to five stars: 
1. There are transaction fees with every purchase and make me question reoccurring purchases and get painful with bigger trades. 
2. The app doesn't offer a good way to track the performance of your investment. It only shows percentage change of the individual coin, but not your personal gains/losses. That would be a nice feature to have.",4,4

2021-10-22,"I have enjoyed the Coinbase platform and for their dedication in educating the public on cryptocurrencies. It‚Äôs UI is easy to use in its simplicity, making it apparent they‚Äôre target customer are inexperienced investors. 

However, after signing up for the recurring buys promotional where you are paid $10 after your 4th and 8th consecutive recurring purchase of $50 or more, I never received the reward. When I reached out to customer support, I received a very generic response that listed the terms of the promotional. I read them and didn‚Äôt see how I was not eligible, so I sent a follow up email asking why I was not eligible. I then received a snarky, unprofessional email thanking me for being ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù when they would not provide why I was not eligible. 

Coinbase has been great. But after how they treated me and are not transparent with their rewards program, I cannot trust them to handle where I am storing my money and cryptocurrency. 

I would highly recommend improving your training with your customer service agents. Worst customer service I have ever received.",2,2
2021-07-23,"Wanted to dip into crypto a bit so I installed this app. Went to make my first purchase and they asked for my bank account password! Turns out they use a service that stores your bank login as plain text and sells you transaction history to advertisers. Then I was speaking with a coworker and he reminded me that Coinbase last year refused to comment about BLM, shut down all social justice discussion at the company, and told their employees they could quit if they didn't like. Well, many did quit. Recently there's been some articles outlining their barely-legal business practices and the upper management's exit strategy. Even the most libertarian person around would cringe at some of their work. If you have any crypto on this app, transfer to another wallet before they go down!",1,2

I got a pop up today that stated very generically: ‚ÄúGet the most out of your experience with Coinbase. We need permission to ensure the content we share is relevant and personalized to you. We take your privacy seriously.‚Äù At the bottom was simply an ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù or ‚ÄúNot Right Now‚Äù 

As a user, I found this confusing. I had no idea what I was either allowing or perhaps possibly denying - perhaps some app functionality? I had a funny feeling this had to do with ad tracking, but I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell from the message itself. It definitely stopped me on my tracks and not in a way that may me feel good about continuing with this app.

For reference, here is the specific parts of the Human Interface Guidelines that are in violation:

I‚Äôve created several tickets (for the same issue), but what happens is they send me an email then I explain the situation a little more and they respond with the same generic answer which doesn‚Äôt solve my problem. Part of the issue is when they respond they create a new thread so the new customer rep can‚Äôt see the whole discussion. Please do something about this I‚Äôve been locked out of the app since mid-October!!! 

I was locked out of my account after I tried to upload my drivers license, but didn‚Äôt realize it was expired. According to Coinbase‚Äôs guidelines you only need to upload an ID if you‚Äôre withdrawing or depositing cryptocurrencies. But my account is locked and I cannot buy/sell with the funds already in my account. 

I would love to give a good review because the app functions great, but due to the customer service I can‚Äôt recommend it to anyone knowing they‚Äôre going to deposit hundreds or thousands of dollars to possibly be locked out of their own account while following the app‚Äôs guidelines.

 So for example, Bitcoin was purchased at $13 per bitcoin more than the displayed price, to sell it I would have to sell it for $7 under the display price (then they add the Coinbase selling fee) do you understand the percentage amount it would have to grow for me to break even off an investment like that?

I recommend this for entry then moving to another marketplace like Bittrex etc for crypto trading.  One thing to note is Coinbase is FDIC insured making it a relatively safe investment especially as long as you are below $100,000.",5,4

Support was unusable on my iPhone, and after working with support for an hour on my computer the support agent did not read my query at all and started sending me pre-written replies about how transactions work on coinbase.

Coin base need to upgrade where customers can click on the portfolio and gain Or loss can see in individual coin or as whole investment where I stand as of today gain or loss.

The portfolio balance comes unsynced and is completely wrong from your actual balance, making a quick glance of your current balance broken. Attempting to contact the company for support through their page doesn‚Äôt address this issue, and their automated message system is a bot that never gets you in contact with a person.

I tried to convert a grand of one coin to another and now the transaction amount is marked at well over a grand, outside the range of figuring price variance during the transaction. I convert a coin at say 10 per coin and when I look back at the receipt it‚Äôll say 14 per coin. That‚Äôs a big difference! Coinbase takes advantage of the fact that other crypto platforms are even worse.",2,1
2019-11-04,"Literally waited 7 days for my funds to be available. I‚Äôve never had a transaction that there weren‚Äôt funds, and the funds cleared my bank after 2 days- there was NO REASON for Coinbase to put a hold on these funds- when I emailed support they gave me some scripted fluff response about how it was for securit reasons- wouldn‚Äôt explain the security reasons, but said they would escalate my request and I would have a response In 3-5 days. 

This bank transfer cleared my bank after 2 days. They held my funds for 5 days- for no reason. And In the meantime, BTC price dropped significantly and i lost a lot of money. 

I would give 1 star out of 100 if I could. They do nothing for you when you have a problem. There is no phone support agents or chat support, WHY AM I PAYING A TRANSACTION FEE IF YOU GUYS ARENT GOING TO BE HERE TO SUPPORT CUSTOMERS WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS!?",1,1
2018-01-02,"My first transaction 
I do not understand the delay in the crediting of money to my account the money leaves my bank account same day and takes two weeks to be credited to my account and I don‚Äôt even know if I own anything. 
It shows zero coins however it shows a pending account at a specific dollar amount and a coin amount however I am unable to do any transfers. 

I recently made it to credit card transaction that supposed to be instantaneous credit 
after I made the purchase it says nine days  to  my account. I would not make that purchase if I knows going to take that long
  I made the first credit card payment and  it was instantaneous. 

I made a bank deposit prior to hitting the confirmation button it said instantaneous or 1 to 3 days ACH transaction this was December 26 I am still waiting for the credit to my account the system leaves me very exposed. Where I have no control over my money. 
The money should go into a cash account and once it shows in the cash account I can purchase the coins at that point you were holding my money hostage at a specific dollar amount and I have no recourse",2,1
2017-12-18,"I‚Äôve made a good chunk of change investing through Coinbase however, the most annoying thing that I have to deal with is the fact that by default when you go to sell whichever coins you have it will deposit the funds into your bank. It would be nice if this could be changed instead of it always being the default. The vast majority of times I‚Äôm just trying to put money into my USD wallet to transfer to another coin. Just recently however, I transferred to my bank on accident and there is a 3-4 business day wait for that. This has been my only complaint so far after iPhone X issues were fixed.",4,2

I found that to be strange since any transaction I did to withdraw money would usually take 5 business day to complete. When I contacted Coinbase customer service they told me there was nothing they can do. Unbelievable, a publicly traded company who prides themselves in security and in one moment all your funds are gone. And they‚Äôre response? ‚ÄúSorry there‚Äôs nothing we can do.‚Äù They claim to protect your account. They claim to offer theft insurance. All LIES from someone who had experienced it firsthand.

Ended up getting my account locked and now it‚Äôs been 3 days no access - I uploaded IDs and verified account immediately.  All these crypto wallets have zero support and hide behind email.  Developers & Investors - if you can build something to compete with all these others and make one simple tweak - culture. Build a team who truly cares for the customer - set up 800 number - hell, offshore it if you want to - but be accessible and easy to work with and you will create a cult.....no wallet has customer care. Build it - they will come!!!!",1,1

I have added my identification card and address over 10 times and it still won‚Äôt process. Meanwhile the prices are fluctuating causing it hard for me to extract s specific amount despite coinbase fees. This is extremely frustrating. I may have to pull out my funds in small fractions of the full portions many times to redeem the entire amount......plus the fees.,5,2

That‚Äôs after my first purchase of $100 that was held 4 days and no bonus. I‚Äôve been waiting to transfer it to Coinbase Pro and I still have 3 days left!!!

   The one thing that is missing is, in the app it doesn't state the price per coin when you purchased it. It states the current value of the selected cryptocurrency, how much of it you bought and the total price you paid. Yes, you can figure out the price per coin using those numbers but it would be a nice addition to a solid app.",4,4

They essentially stole my litecoin aka fraud and are not even acknowledgeing that they are having issues with deposits into GDAX from coinbase.

Hopefully the merchant ‚Äúdenies the transaction‚Äù. Once they obviously didn‚Äôt, I called back and was told I needed to wait 10-45 days for claims to be processed. At least I got 24/7 customer service so they can listen to me vent all day. (And no I haven‚Äôt gotten any word yet.)
Also when you buy crypto, the price you‚Äôre quoted at is always higher and when you sell crypto, the price is always quoted lower when the transaction completes.

Our referral program is fully automated. Note that we are unable to manually review or credit any referrals that are not automatically paid out. We are unable to provide specific information as to why any referrals may have been deemed ineligible.

A few of the more common reasons are that the account was created but not completed or verified, or that the account has not fully complete a purchase up to $100 worth of digital currency.‚Äù

My account is verified and my first investment was $100. Plus I made additional investments that day. Basically, they‚Äôre saying something may be wrong with our system, but we don‚Äôt care and aren‚Äôt going to investigate. 

Why should they care? They make sure their system works well enough to get your money when you transfer money in or out.

I‚Äôm trying to buy Litecoin, and the screen is so big that I can only see the numbers one through nine‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even buy $50 because the zero is off the bottom of the screen, and there is no by button.

It‚Äôs almost unbelievable how sub par this company is all while your billionaire ceo has articles on how big and expensive his $177M megamansion is in California. I‚Äôd be embarrassed frankly but I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter when you have a $9B personal networth. Shows true character though.",1,2

It‚Äôs non existent pretty much. I‚Äôve had my withdrawal from the vault stuck and unable to get my money out. Already been waiting for a week and emailed multiple times. Employees are untrained and give generic answers. You‚Äôre on your own basically. Unreal for a company to handle this much money of their customers and not help. This will be their downfall and already is honestly. You can tell by their stock performance and amounts of people switching to other exchanges everyday.

2021-10-22,Over all the app is easy to use etc. The fees is what‚Äôs sus about this app. There needs to be an investigation into this app for all the fees. I understand the buy and sell fee. But the fact you can‚Äôt sell all your holding at once and they lower amount to lower of what you have is sketchy . Also the cash out fee said .50 cents and then it charged me $3.78. What is up with all the fees. Buy/sell/deposit . This company is for sure going to profit for that reason because it‚Äôs taking away from all us . Millions of people using it and those fees will add up . Be careful people only use companies  that you trust and who knows what info they are selling about us .,2,2
2020-07-25,"App is great.  Easy to use.  Wish there was an indicator around your own portfolios performance.  In the portfolio tab, you can see your value (dollars) of each crypto, and there‚Äôs a chart to show you change over time.

But, no where that I can find is there any percentage gain of your portfolio.  Think this would be something in there.  Especially when you invest frequently, with numerous entry price points; kind of tough to track your personal performance.

2020-08-20,"Although they claim not to charge a fee for most transactions, EVERY transaction is charged a ‚Äúmargin ‚Äú that is nicely hidden in the multi-paged fee schedule.
  What does this mean? It means if you are buying XCOIN for $1.00 at the current rate posted on their app/site, each share/coin will cost you $1.03 or $1.04 no one can explain to me exactly how they calculate it. It‚Äôs a percentage so even very inexpensive coins rack up a bigger expense than if they just charged fees upfront.
  Also if you are selling a coin for $1 you will only get $.96 for it, or if transferring from one coin to another both will be charged ‚Äúmargin‚Äù so you are paying twice.
   Worst of all, if you are JUST Moving your portfolio from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro, you are charged margin on EVERY piece of coin you move (to use their app none the less).
   Couple all of this with the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE (not exaggerating) to speak to a human customer service agent on the phone. All customer Service is done via email at an average of 2-3 days per response.

This is absolutely unacceptable. Not only is it impossible for me to give this form what it wants, despite the pretty obvious fact that I am a real person with an SSN, but it will LOCK ME OUT for 24 hours if I try to submit it more than 3 times.

Not only that, their customer service is perpetually overloaded. I can‚Äôt contact them at all, and apparently emails are taking several days just to receive an answer.

When I reached out for help their response was that they couldn‚Äôt do anything after the charge had been placed.

Now that I use multiple exchanges, I learned it isn‚Äôt true. This time I was smarter and did a screenshot. Under ‚ÄúHome‚Äù the rate was $5.04, when I went to sell, the sell rate was $5.02...I backed out and went to buy, the buy rate was $5.06 (the rate shown on all the other exchanges btw), I went back again to sell and it was at $5.01, all the while Home and Portfolio said $5.04. 
I searched the support page for an explanation...Nothing. Emailed the company...no response. Usually they are very response. 
Now I see they are going public. $.05 difference being retained without explanation on assets is suspicious to me. It concerns me. 
And no this was not the gas fee; it was the listed rate. 
All have started moving all of my assets to other exchanges that have proven more reliable to me after testing small amounts.",1,2
2021-02-17,I had been using coinbase for a while. Suddenly they demanded additional verification beyond the driver's license I had already submitted. I tried to submit my passport but it kept saying I had already passed verification.  So now I'm at the highest level of verification but it still won't let me buy sell or transfer money in or out. I try contacting support to clarify things but they keep saying I need to submit additional ID like a passport. I try explaining that their website tells me I've already passed verification to the highest level and it won't let me submit anything else. They've stopped responding to my emails now. Why do I even need to submit my passport or additional ID? Am I just supposed to take a picture of my passport and email it to them?  Who does that?,1,1
2018-01-08,"First issue: So you can move money from your bank account to your USD wallet in Coinbase without fees. However, your bank transfers it and it‚Äôs gone immediately and Coinbase sits on it for 5-7 days, before it shows up in your wallet. Im sure they are collecting interest in your money before they move it to your account.

Second issue: When you do have a funded USD wallet and try to use it to buy digital currency, at least bitcoin cash, you are not allowed to chose your USD wallet to purchase be digital currency with. The app forces you to either choose bank account or credit card, with the higher fees for both. Why can you not choose the funds you already have deposited with them?

Third issue: If you choose to use a bank account to buy digital currency, then once again you wait 7 days for the purchase to be made. With the volatility of digital currency, this make Coinbase and obsolete tool.

You can use your USD wallet to trade with GDAX, but if your not buying that way, there is zero point using Coinbase.

For me the hunt continues for a digital currency wallet that actually works, makes sense, and isn't a rip off.",1,1
2017-12-06,"I don't normally give any bad reviews for an app but anyways I downloaded the app, everything was working fine. I wanted to buy more of bitcoins so I decided to login in to Gdax account(since there transaction fee is cheaper). All of a sudden, I am locked out of coin base and my account is ‚Äútemporarily disable‚Äù. I emailed them but I still haven't gotten any response back. I called their customer support which is very horrible by the way. It took me 50 mins in the phone to speak to an agent. He told me their specialist is really busy and they have gotten my email support ticket and it will take them 3-5 business days to reply to my email which is ridiculous. It was very frustrating seeing the bitcoin value rise from $10,900 to $12,000 and I couldn't do anything about it!",1,1
2022-05-26,In general Coinbase is really easy to use to buy cryptos that they support. The only issue I have is the amount of time it takes for prices to change. Many times I bought and sold based on the value of cryptos on Coinbase and they were off by enough to make the trades unprofitable. In fast moves up or down Coinbase lags behind and obviously it is very profitable for them to make moves buying and selling knowing that everyone on Coinbase is seeing numbers 5-15% different than actual prices.,5,4
2023-04-14,"Coinbase double charged me on a single purchase, no big deal right? They just took $200 without my permission‚Ä¶ So I reach out to them asking about it and get no response for weeks. I contact my bank about the problem to escalate it, and my bank found enough evidence to see it was indeed a double purchase. So they reversed the transaction. Now Coinbase has frozen all my wallets, and I can‚Äôt even withdraw them to a different wallet. And with ZERO customer service, I‚Äôll be locked out of my funds for an undefined amount of time. It‚Äôs already been weeks. You‚Äôve been warned. I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm denied for further review 4 times in 6 months, with month long periods they demand I cannot contact them again.",1,1

So now I‚Äôm just wondering if I can cash out or will I lose my funds coinbase?!? And just logged on today and it‚Äôs asking me to ‚Äúverify my account info bye Sep 22, 2022 or I‚Äôll be limited to the amount I‚Äôm able to trade‚Äù pretty convenient for this to happen during a market crash..

Currently, I‚Äôm traveling and have renewed my license online but it‚Äôs only in paper form but I have my US citizen passport as one of the best verifications to show but for some reason Coinbase doesn‚Äôt allow any other types of verifications besides ID and license, which is terrible.

Kind of hoping this is a bug that snuck in with the updates on animations. I know whitespace seems trifling but I‚Äôve already switched apps to monitor prices. Would love to switch back to coinbase.

Support just says ‚Äúmarket fluctuations‚Äù when I am sending receipts showing dollar amounts used for sold and purchased.

To developer: I have already contacted support and sent screen shots of balances and issues. Was even told that you locked in prices when exchanging even during fluctuations. Lost $6k in being unable to sell, that is whatever. The missing money is my biggest concern that has not once been answered. Already leaving the platform.",1,1

They said the user agreement says that only one person can use the Coinbase account!! Not sure how my wife‚Äôs name on the bank account that funds it has anything to do with the user of the coinbase account. They want me to send pdf bank statements for verification . Sounds like one of those Nigerian prince needs some help email cons to me . I‚Äôve not had this problem with other platforms I use . There fees and bottom feeder app it‚Äôs just not worth it. Please look at all the negative reviews and look for a different platform. Happy trading!!!! Just don‚Äôt use this one.,1,1
2021-11-02,"Just started using this app. I like it for the most part and it feels very user friendly similar to Robinhood, EXCEPT,  your portfolio doesn‚Äôt give much data on your purchases. I‚Äôd like to see a clear number on my profit or losses in real-time for each coin. It doesn‚Äôt show my average or percentage increase or total $ loss or gain. That‚Äôs something I really found useful and informative on Robinhood and would like to see it implemented here.

If the developer gets around to it, I‚Äôd really like to talk to them and see if we can‚Äôt figure something out, if they‚Äôre not already working on a fix.

Thanks üôÇ",4,4
2021-10-17,Coinbase is great and they offer plenty of options for their users. However I do not recommend the coinbase card. Their customer service is subpar as well. I‚Äôve contacted customer support many times with nothing but automated generic responds to my issues. Coinbase card seemed promising but it can be a huge hassle to users considering even when you verify your identity and deposit directly from a bank account your funds are put on hold for 7 days until you can use them. For someone like myself who wants to use the service often it is an extreme inconvenience.,3,2
2021-10-05,"I was up 70% on my portfolio and wanted to sell as I seen my portfolio dive a bit and hopefully gain some profit . Coinbase will not let me sell , trade, or transfer crypto while it is actively crashing . Tried many times and even got a hold of customers service and not a word out of them . My profit has all been lost. I have the app updated and great network connection I don‚Äôt see how it could be an issue other than them holding peoples money and not letting them do what they want to do with it, when they want to do it . I suggest another investing platform don‚Äôt let this happen to you . Also they just got hacked and many users valuable information were leaked in a hacker database . Good job coinbase keeping us happy and secure ! NOT",1,1
2021-10-03,"Could not sell my coins. Had less than $200 only on one. Customer service could not fix the issues and stated only to withdraw in several increments or a lower amount. Aka nearly 20 to $30 in fees for several transactions to sell and still had to leave a dollar in the account. Highly disappointed! No reimbursement for the extra transaction fees. Also trying to view what you started with in a coin and how much it‚Äôs increased or decreased is a hassle. Must actually calculate how much you invested each time and total it. App is a complete mess, the coin base pro also had too many bugs couldn‚Äôt even login in the app. Robin Hood was a much better app even though it had fewer crypto to choose from.",1,1
2021-09-17,"I love the app along with all its features. It‚Äôs super easy to use and makes it interesting to trade crypto. However, after installing it on my ipad I found that the app does not really support ipads. When opening it up it only allows you to run it in portrait mode, and is only a portion of the screen. The sides are just black bars and the graphics are poor. It made me question if this was the same coinbase I had on my phone. If this could be fixed or if there could be better support for other devices such as ipad this would be amazing!!!",4,3
2021-06-20,"I have used Coinbase for a couple years now but my acct was hacked, over a month ago and I can not get customer support to respond to me or get my account back for me. I didn't have a lot of money and glad that I didn't and I encourage anyone who does have a lot of money in here to get it out quickly after my experience so far. I will update this review IF they ever decide to get my account with my money back to me. I encourage everyone to just go online and search Coinbase backed accounts and read the horror stories of how they never get peoples money back to them after a hack, which leads a person to wonder, who is doing this hacking and why is their money not returned???????",1,1

I sent them another email saying I wanted to cancel my account.  They replied within 2 hours on how to delete my account.  60-90 days just to tell me how to view my notifications within the app, which should be basic and easy information but how to delete my account they reply within 2 hours.

I went to sell the the bitcoin then buy some but it then debited my bank account when I really wanted to use my USD Coinbase wallet. They should really allow you to set a preference. Twice It happened to me, I almost over-drafted my account. Luckily I deposit the money in my account in time both Times.

Coinbase hasn‚Äôt emailed or messaged me about this on going problem lasting over 2 days now.. 

On top of that they are holding my fund 3-4 days after they have already received payment through my bank.

They said it might be several days before someone gets back to me, and of course I have heard nothing.

2020-02-13,"Starting with the good,  you have a multitude of tradeable cryptocurrency, customer service is quick to respond to your issue, and it is fairly simple to navigate the app.  

The cons that I have notice is that you are limited to how much you can invest at once(this may be a security feature for the company), there is more than a 2% spread when you convert your coins resulting in a dramatic loss in fiat currency(where the company states it can be more or less than 2% spread depending on some factors), and the same goes for investing into the coins($1000 with a $14 fee somehow became $980 instantly).

I recommend investing your money, wait for a good time to withdraw, and continue on that path.

I personally find other apps better and more clear but since I have money tied up in this app and the customer service is good I will ride it out for now.",5,3

On top of that, I did profit off of some shiba inu coin and when I transferred it into a different currency, my entire portfolio balance dropped by $100 with no explanation. And no, the value of the coins did not plummet within the 1 second that I transferred it. From 9:59am to 10:00am my balance is missing $100 with no explanation and Coinbase SUPPOSEDLY has zero fees but that‚Äôs a lie cuz they‚Äôre robbing you.

They basically are holding my own money hostage for 10 days. It exists if I want to trade inside their platform, but it‚Äôs ‚Äúpending‚Äù if I want to move it anywhere else, including back to myself.

2022-01-18,"Coinbase seems to be the easiest and most secure way to buy bitcoin as well as any other coin on the market.  You can use a variety of payment methods - but each has a limit 

The only downside is that there is a 8 day hold on your coin - if you use your bank to purchase the coin - which does not include the time it takes to transfer the money from your back to their account - so the hold could be 10-12 days total before you can send coin to another wallet",5,4
2021-05-19,I started trading crypto about a month ago and like Coinbase the best out of everything I‚Äôve tried. I like that you can see what the fee is going to be before you buy something not afterwards. I also like that you can transfer one crypto to another for free. Lastly getting paid to learn about different crypto is cool and you‚Äôre not stuck with something you don‚Äôt want because of the transfer ability and this is a good way to make up for any fees you spent on buying assets.,5,5

Only that the US gov‚Äôt can no longer shut them down like similar scam sites.  Do not be fooled by their apparent quality service.

Alarmed I reached out to their help desk, they offered an apology. And nothing else. The rep admitted that there was no suspicious activity on my account. So this was just a random thing.

At this point its worthless compared to what its going to be in a few years and coinbase helps you get that foot in the door!

Every time you sell or buy, your fee total is deducted plus extra money.

I decided okay, I‚Äôll just transfer from one crypto to another when I want to exit a trade. There are 0$ commission fees for that. I go this route and $50 dollar change in price from one coin to another! No fees, but less capital for me. Where does that money go?

2021-02-08,It's easy to use but very limited in terms of coins you are allowed to buy. If you are starting out with $500 the fees will take up all your profits so it's extremely hard to make money. For example I bought several coins and my portfolio was up $75 I sold all of my position so I could buy everything back on the dip. After selling everything I had a $9 profit because the fees to sell are high. So you if you start out with a small amount do not expect to keep the profit you money generates in a diversified portfolio. You will have to put all of your money in one coin to avoid the fees.  Kraken is hard to make deposits but you can buy any coin you want and the fees are next to nothing. .,2,3

Each time I got the same lame error message after I tried to send the trade.
Even their email from customer service had that same error message.

What I seek is clarity on 2 things via their ux... 1) can we get a clearer understanding of what the underlying purchase and the growth or lack there of is.... 2) can you explain your fees as some may be averaging in to these over time. Taking 2% on 100 is fine but you actually rake 2 on 50... can you clearly state, as we buy hold and sell this asset/currency/whatever. We need to know that because we pay you, you hold our fractional and you offer us liquidity and use.  These rates are onerous. This could be a currency or an asset, but I care how you treat us.

Don‚Äôt expect to play the market with an app like this. You won‚Äôt make anything trying to sell high and buy low. The fees make sure of that.",5,4
2018-07-21,"When you finally had enough and want to sale everything you have on the app their is a few problems. 
1. You can‚Äôt sale the Max because of its programming. So you can only sale at max 1/2 of what you have.
2. Their is a charge fee to take what you bought. Depending on how much you had invested. even if you want to take 1 dollar out there is a .99 cent fee to take it out. 

Worst investment I have ever made. You want to invest into something worth your time. Read a people skills book so you can get ahead of the pack. communication is a lost art and people are super sensitive to good people skills because Majority of people today lack the ability to hold a solid conversation. based on the programming they get from social media and the things they follow.",1,1
2021-08-09,"I have to say first of all. I really like this app. Simple interface for newcomers. The opportunity of buying and selling crypto is an amazing experience on coinbase. I love the earn and learn feature as well. 

The is a few things I like to see. It'll be good to add a feature on the portfolio tap that will say how much money they gain or loss instead of just percentage.

Another thing is the notification for price change seem to only work for ETH and BTC. like to see that for other crypto",5,4
2017-10-12,"With passcode enabled, if you're on the Accounts screen and switch away to a different app, your account balances are still visible in the switch apps view. This is a disclosure problem.
Also, it sometimes asks for the passcode repeatedly, sometimes three times in a row.
These glitches have (so far) only been minor inconveniences, but they are signs of an app that is poorly designed from a security point of view, which means it likely also has some exploitable flaws we don't know about yet.
The previous version of the app did not show these signs.",4,2
2023-02-17,"App works as intended by the developer (if the intent is to trick people into giving them money) just hope you never need support bc you simply will not get it. They hide fees everywhere, specify an amount you will receive back by using their debit card and then after promising a set rate for a month 3 days later they drop it to 1% AFTER you payed the 4% fee to purchase. I‚Äôve dealt with this kind of service for over 2 years, 20+ tickets sent in and 4-5 dummies over the phone and am now up to 3 issues I need assistance with but cannot get it. If I could give less than 1 star I would. DO NOT USE COINBASE, the app is purposely made to hide fees and screw you over.",1,1

Numbers are all over the place and it‚Äôs definitely NOT in the consumers favor as a couple hundred at a time seems to be robbed from every single transaction.

No money ever went into my PayPal account, but I did get a notice that someone tried to log into my PayPal soon after. To make it worse, there are no instructions to explain just how this app works and I cannot seem to find any record to see just how this happened.

You would think that if the money I deposited into coin base was being used that the balance would go down every time I purchased a crypto, but that does not appear to be happening as the balance remains unchanged from my initial cash deposit.

I would like to see them adjust the home screen to make it easy to move crypto you are watching up and down the page. Also, after favoriting 50 coins, any doing after that does not show on the homepage correctly. For instance, if you have 50 coins favorited already and you then favorite Tron, the 51st coin on your list instead shows a repeat of one on your list of 50 (ex. Litecoin) but if you click on it it will then go to trons charts. Very inconvenient",4,3

I would rather spend money on an app that doesn‚Äôt have any fees when buying or moving coin.

Ridiculous, those funds have been settled for a week, and I'm waiting because your app wasn't working four days ago. Overall, I'm uninstalling the app once my money finally shows up. There are cheaper ways to invest in crypto if you really want to.",2,1

There seems to be a serious lag time of at least 12 hours. I‚Äôve used CoinTracker to confirm this. If I bought coin at 7:00 AM UTC time stamped in CounBase, CoinTracker shows it time stamped at 7:00 PM UTC of the previous day. Another confirmation is to buy coin and immediately try to sell at the same price. Your coin is suddenly worth a lot less. Feels like a bait and switch.",2,2

Cons:
Somewhat high fees. Most of the recent reviews are very negative with problems customer support or delayed/not working transactions.

Purchases I made showed up right away but took one or a few days before being available for trade. Finally decided to send ada off Coinbase. The first small transaction failed with an unknown error. Not sure if it was Coinbase or something I did wrong. After trying again the next day with a small transaction it successfully transferred after about 1-2 minutes. 5-6 larger transactions all succeeded  within 1-3 minutes also off of exchange with no issues.

In the beginning I received an email stating I was verified than I was prompted again to verify with no success. Multiple emails and support tickets since the beginning of January and no response. This is probably one of the ways for Coinbase to ban users from their platform. There are too many complaints on Reddit and other sites regarding Coinbase and their lack of customer support which is considered nonexistent. These positive reviews are most likely paid reviews. An app and company that has hardly any customer service would not have so many positive reviews. Conduct a search on ‚ÄúCoinbase complaints‚Äù and see for yourself.,1,1

If they showed what price people purchased at, they could also easily show net gains/losses on any asset as well. These two features alone would make this 5 stars.

Also the app doesn‚Äôt show you the price that you bought the crypto at it just shows you how many coins you have and how much they are worth all in total at the current moment.

In Addition, when you buy a fiat coin stock at the price you have during that moment is not the price you get it at they charge an additional 2 cents on average or couple dollars tacked onto the purchase making you have to get an ever more increase in the price to come out even. I did not notice this at first however looking at my transactions and times and market value at those times I was charged over price! Buyer beware would recommend kraken.

I wanted very much to like this company but cannot stress enough how little they seem to care about their customers.

They do not show purchase price of assets nor amount gained or lost which they should. 

They should put average purchase price next to each coin owned, total increase/decrease by percent and absolute amount, and the same for the whole portfolio.

The way they feed information is only a chart based on total account value which is not useful and manipulates how performance looks as adding more money into the account makes it look like you have succeeded as an investor/trader. 

It is almost impossible to find the purchase price of the coins which it is clear they are trying to hide. It‚Äôs transparent they believe hiding this information will manipulate users into trading more. I assume cause they don‚Äôt want to display losses

In my opinion older generations shouldn‚Äôt under estimate Younger generations. We all treat them like second class most of the time. We all treat Younger Generations like their all immature but actually most are mature and are proven to be proper adults. 

So I think To make this app better is to allow 17 years old at least to start using bitcoin with Coinbase. Let‚Äôs stop treating Younger Generations bad because most are mature and grown up already.

2019-03-07,"Coinbase is a pretty fluid platform on which to exchange crypto's, especially for beginners. The biggest problem I have with it is the premium prices for the exchanges.

It should be illegal to fee people for a market order. I especially advise against swapping coins. You‚Äôll be scratching your head wondering where all your money went. Example. You have $1000 in ABC coin. You want to swap for XYZ coin. They‚Äôll tell you you‚Äôre getting $1000 worth of XYZ. But once it‚Äôs finalized you‚Äôll look and see $893,1,1

Their support team is awful and they send you the same generalized email over and over. It‚Äôs as if a robot is running this place.

Crypto has a long was to go before it gets mass adopted just because of frustrating experiences like this. I would have used Coinbase a lot if my experience was seamless. I would not recommend.

Update: as soon as I wrote this review, my transaction was processed. What really pisses me off is that the execution price is as of the day I bought the currency - while this transaction was in pending for 10 DAYS (!!!) I already lost money without actually owning the currency. This is unacceptable! Will  it use and will not recommend.",1,1
2022-02-08,"I‚Äôve been using CoinBase for over a year and have noticed discrepancies in the amount that I should have after a trade and the amount that actually ends up in my account.

Today I called them to ask about it. I explained my situation to the customer support representative, showed him the numbers and transaction reference, and did the math for him (which was ~3% of the total amount).

He said this kind of thing happens and it probably has to do with transaction fees. I responded that the confirmation page during the transaction said there was a $0.00 transaction fee. He said ‚Äúthere may be other fees or something.‚Äù

After calmly explaining that I can accept fees or differences if the price changes during the trade, but I need to see something that confirms where my money is going, he said he would have to escalate my issue to someone else and they would email me when they are able.

TL:DR
3% of my transaction disappeared, no trace. CoinBase said they don't know what happened BUT they can send me an email.",1,1
2022-01-25,"Not only is the app finicky but their customer service is absolutely horrendous. I experienced an issue with my payment method on their app and reached out to support via email. I told them I had already tried the x, y and z troubleshooting methods and their next three responses to me were to try the x, y and z troubleshooting methods. We went back and forth and every one of their emails was an automatic response that had already been sent to me. I am convinced their email support is a robot. There is nothing more frustrating and concerning than using a platform to invest a lot of money, only to have zero access to real, live, human help when issues arise. 

I do not trust this app for a second.",1,1
2021-09-10,I have come to the conclusion that coinbase is made up of a bunch of thieves. They disabled my account and have given me no reason why they have done it. I have been trying for several months to get access unsuccessfully. They send the same emails over and over saying they asked me for information which I have already sent multiple times. If they don‚Äôt allow me access to my money then they are basically stealing that money from me as far as I‚Äôm concerned. If you go on the Internet and look at reviews you‚Äôll see that there are many other people having the same problem. Do not use them. Their customer service is the worst.,1,1

Crypto like Doge, bitToreent, DigiBite, holo, etc has been under review for more than 6 months and still not available for trading. Please can the management release those crypto for trading because the company is indirectly asking their their customers to use other platforms that can support and provide our trading needs.

I‚Äôm unable to move any of my coins to any wallets even coinbase‚Äôs own wallet. However there is no real customer service that can help with that or even answer my questions.

My biggest complaint is with the service itself. The fees really pile up. I used the app for a little over a week and racked up over $100 in fees just buying and selling around $1000 in crypto. 

Another issue is with recurring buys. The app begs you to setup a recurring buy of crypto which isn‚Äôt a problem by itself. However, once you set it up, you are unable to cancel/stop it from within the app. You must goto the website to stop it.",3,4

Now they are automated alerts sent however they only range from 6-15% fluctuation in the graph. They have removed alot of features that actually make the user experience more unnecessarily complex requiring more hand calculations and less efficiency to seize the market. i dont think the app developers are looking to correct these either unfortunately.",2,1

There‚Äôs been several occasions where I have seen the crypto currency going for a certain price and then try to buy it and all of a sudden it is 2-5% higher within  8 seconds of initiation of the transaction.  SO DOUBLE CHECK THE CURRENCY PRICE BEFORE YOU TAP ‚ÄòPurchase.‚Äô  I feel like the transaction fees are a little steep there are better apps out there that charge less.,5,4
2019-05-06,Do not put money into this app. They tell you if you pay for BTC with your bank account your money is available to send immediately (fake I bought $150 worth and was only allowed to trade $4-$8 depending on the day). They claim the bank has to pay it 1st and my bank paid days ago. They also said when you sell you can withdraw to your bank account immediately. This is also bull of me $150 I‚Äôm allowed to have $4 of it. Basically wasted $150 on a fake app that came highly recommended.

I wish I could use it. It sounds pretty cool, but if they‚Äôre too interested in trying to get this info and inflexible to authorize my phone with the email (verified to them on my PC), there must be an underlying reason.

There‚Äôs no data anywhere, just price graphs and current price. No limit purchases. Transfers are horribly slow and no one should ever transfer into a crypto, just to your fiat. The company also has 0 accountability, if you accidentally submit a purchase they will not reverse it period. If I exchanged here I‚Äôd have to have a legal pad next to me and a TI-87 and do all the math myself. It‚Äôs only good for transferring to gdax and then elsewhere as you can save a small chunk of the enormous fees they‚Äôre charging for micro traders (people who are trading under $1k euro and storing on exchange wallets).

Sure enough when the price skyrocketed, they locked me out of my account and while I was dealing with customer service basically telling me I was screwed, my stop loss sold when the prices tanked a few days later...

When I try to get help or information on my problems  nobody seems competent or willing to help. I‚Äôve never been treated or ignored from a company like Coinbase has done to me.

If when you log in to your account you see an exchange company's logo, your money is not safe from malicious, out-of-control governance. Everything you leave in their system can be frozen at any time and your money can be stolen.

Even cashapp does this with stocks so you can always know how much you've gained per investment. In coinbase, we can see the graph on our portfolio and we can even see how many coins we got at a particular time. However, the actual value will always change with the market.

Not sure why the calculation price of sales and buys always go 300 in favor of Coinbase but that is annoying.

When you trade currencies you get hit with a fee.  He charges you a premium for the coins because he owns them.  They hold your money for days after they get it and give you a reason I can‚Äôt even remember.  What I get is the app holds you money to collect interest.  They use your money to buy more coins.  I just want my money I had in so I can close my account.  I watched my buy in price go up twice.  I started writing it down as soon as I bought in.

One thing I would like to add is calculated gains for each crypto asset I own and total gains gains realized and unrealized. This way, I can have a better picture of how much I made because it‚Äôs hard to tell what was simply a ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù that increased my portfolio‚Äôs value versus and actual gain. Anyways, I like this app and I do believe this is a doable feature.",4,4
2021-06-06,I like the service and the product but trying to get help with there support has been terrible and they make it so hard if it‚Äôs not one of there options you need help with they make it hard to get to ask a question this is a USA company that just had an IPO they should at least have easy support like email support and definitely live chat and when your dealing with somebody money they should have some phone support Hope you get this fixed love the product why do I need an nickname I‚Äôve tried 6 different names to do a review,3,3
2021-06-02,"Everything was fine till it logged out. I‚Äôve been using other apps,Because it seems I can log on with them after I put in my name and my password. Coinbase however has been telling me to wait for SMS that never arrives. I verified that I had the correct phone number, but I have been unsuccessful in logging in or contacting anybody. It seems like something they should fix if they want people to use their product, but what do I know I‚Äôm just a consumer",4,1
2021-04-29,Looked around for a while to find a CryptoTrader.   Coin base is the easiest I found to use.  It links to my bank account easy and never have a complaint. I been with coinbase since 2017 and they are constantly adding new crypto to trade (when I first joined they only had three to offer if not mistaken).  I recommend Coinbase to everyone who asks how to get started. I do have an account with a competitor and slowly moving those coins to this account.,5,5
2021-04-14,"It seems apparent, CoinBase knows exactly when everything will increase and decrease in price and has manipulated my bank transfer capabilities in order to charge me for losses on assets it sold off when I attempted several times to make payment when it claimed insufficient funds which was highly inaccurate. I have even made several attempts to link other accounts with false errors claimed by Coinbase. I appreciate the knowledge on Crypto, but CB is fraud.",5,1
2020-12-11,"Overall, the coinbase app has served it most important purpose of trading and tracking crypto that I‚Äôm interested in. However, it has its drawbacks as well. First, they often offer different new cryptos for watching videos, inviting others, taking surveys. Many times there are technical issues and you never receive the crypto and waste your time. Secondly, there is almost no customer service. On occasion I have contacted support, about addressing the issues stated above, only to never get a response. Since this is just feature and bug that doesn‚Äôt detract from the app‚Äôs primary purpose, I give it 3 stars.",3,3

Even though I can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs going on in my account, I have received emails that there has been activity and fees being charged to my account, in the meantime.

This is makes using BTC as a payment option far too slow to be reliable and that is completely unacceptable.

Multiple requests for two weeks resulted in the same standard language for setting up an account, even though I‚Äôve done that. Nothing is personalized. In fact, I have done more than everything asked to set up an account, but it just doesn‚Äôt function. It‚Äôs unreal that there no phone number or live chat function to help customers.

Unless somebody hijacks your account, THEY WILL NOT TALK TO YOU! No humans available. 
It cleared my bank to them. They demanded a 2nd payment of the same amount ($47) and wont be reached for me to talk to. THIS APP IS A FRAUD AND A SCAM, with NO way to contact when they steal your money for no reason. AVOID BITCOIN AT ALL COSTS, please. Or they may steal from you too!",1,1

It was all just to find out that I cannot even verbally communicate with the people who are financially responsible for accounts. That I was to hang up and they would email me. That was almost 4 hours ago I have received no emails and cannot do anything with my account.

Isn‚Äôt the point of signing up to join the system? If you want a company that has your back stay away from Coinbase. They don‚Äôt put in any effort into making their signup process or interfaces easy to use or even usable at all.

2022-03-24,I actually like the versatility of Coinbase. The fees are high but the ease of use for when I want to fomo is so easy. Bot integration is expensive to run compared to other exchanges and some coin are limited. Wish the U$ would get their crap together so we could get a few more options. Overall probably the easiest and most beginner friendly crypto exchange or at least a buy in point for those in US.,5,4
2017-12-12,"DO NOT USE! If you‚Äôre new to cryptocurrency, DO NOT use this site. Any time there is a high spike or drop in prices, the site/app crashes, which means you can‚Äôt capitalize on opportunity when a certain coin is hot. Conversely, you can‚Äôt cut your losses when the coin cools down in price, which has costs many thousands of dollars (Just check Twitter
And see for yourself)

Also, their fees are insane. They kill you on high fees for each withdrawal, deposit, trade, and more.

Their customer support is overwhelmed. They can‚Äôt get back to you in a reasonable time. They seem to be manipulating prices (I have no confirmation of this). They don‚Äôt refund the $50 fees you pay when their service crashes, and it costs you thousands.

Honestly, I didn‚Äôt lose much from them bc I cashed out before they could screw me like they did others. Trading and investing are inherently risky, so I‚Äôm fine with the risk. However, losing money due to a company‚Äôs negligence and incompetence is unacceptable.

The customer support said they couldn‚Äôt do anything and all the money that was taken was not reimbursable. I also had the 2 factor authentication set up.

Tried to sell to see if that helps, but the app tells me to confirm my ID. I click that, the spinning wheel of death appears and then it just returns me to the main page.

I don‚Äôt know if they were having computer glitches or what was going on but now I have lost almost all of my money my friends have lost a great deal of their money and Coinbase doesn‚Äôt care.

3rd problem. Today I go to buy more and it tells me I have a Zero limit? My linked bank account says I have money available but Coinbase says my limit is zero.

For BTC investors who do regular automatic purchases, and then take partial profits, filling out the IRS-required paperwork is very time-consuming. Coinbase should at least permit export of trade data in an IRS-friendly schedule D-like format. Otherwise, they lose market share to brokers like Robinhood who provide 1099-B forms for their customers.",3,1

Want to verify that ID? Good joke. They refuse to verify your ID for no reason. You could take the clearest and most well lit photo of your ID and they couldn‚Äôt care any less. They won‚Äôt verify it. So, now your funds are stuck in their hands and they aren‚Äôt going anywhere.

Secondly the App is quick to sign you up and will link your bank account/ cc to allow you to buy currency but will not return your if you happen to make a mistake and transfer it to the wrong account. (Which happens all the time). Even in your own wallet. 

Thirdly they do not offer much information about any of the currency‚Äôs they offer. It‚Äôs offered but you must do a lot of your own searching about information on how well each coin is doing. Which you probably should anyway but it would be nice to see current market rates in the app as you are purchasing.

You lose about 10% in price value and almost 2% on a conversation to a better coin you like, now you have about $59. Then the new coin you like goes down about 20%. Now you have $45 in Coinbase after a few months, you need it and want to sell it and there is another $3 fee for selling, and now your $70 investment is now about $40. If you are lucky. I‚Äôm sure most of everyone who has gotten coinbase has lost the money they have put in. Rather it be from fees or just buying the dumb coins that Coinbase pushes onto you",1,1

I‚Äôve given the team the benefit of the doubt with the horrible performance but there‚Äôs been zero improvement over the last few releases and no release notes indicating work being attempted on the issues.

2020-04-16,"Don‚Äôt listen to the nay-sayers because they are only mad about the transfer layover between being able to send your bitcoin, but you‚Äôre always allowed to trade your bitcoin stock so there is nothing sketchy about this, it‚Äôs simply how the system works. If you can roll with the punches bitcoin really is a great way to use currency, especially on the internet. Is it less efficient then pulling out your debit card for something ? Yes. But with the blockchain effort, it feels a lot more secure to me. Thanks",5,4

However coinbase itself is having a lot of issues. The forums are full of reports of people's transactions not going through. Their assets get stuck and blocked. I've been helping one person who has $100k stuck on coinbase. He can't make purchases. Can't move it to another location. Can't withdraw back to his bank account. Support have not helped saying he needs to talk to an account specialist but they don't call back. 

His account was verified. bought some btc successfully. Then each transfer that was sent from his bank account started to get returned. With coinbase keeping ¬£1 for themselves each time they rejected the transfer. The system did not give hint of why it was failing. Then a couple of successful transactions went through then it stopped working again taking one pound each time. Now his money is stuck there and he can't do anything with it. 

This is a very common issue people are experiencing.",2,2

I still have never heard back on either of the tickets I opened with them through the help center (fortunately it was for less than $1,000, but still infuriating).

There‚Äôs no cost basis so when you buy, make sure you note manually somewhere what your cost basis was. The biggest one is there are no price alerts.

2021-04-13,These people are straight up thieves. I did a conversion and they took $200 from me. It was not a fee but they did not give me the proper value of what the stock was at. I was converting from one cryptocurrency to another and the current value was not given to me. A value of $.70 less was given during the conversion and they took the difference of the money. Be very careful in dealing with these people. I have talked with several others that are having many issues with them. They have even used other cryptocurrencies to pay for a purchase without authorization when a bank account did not have sufficient funds.,1,1

under a dollar without staking options, the fee's

another fee when you sell any portion of it. So,
watch carefully you could be in the hole with their
fees added on. They do have a lot of coins to
choose from but so do other platforms and with
other platforms, you have MUCH lower fees, better
graphing charts, profit/loss, price alerts, buy/sell
options and many more investment tools. I have no
problem paying a fee for doing business, however,

2017-11-30,Coinbase is a great company and wallet/exchange. They look for the long term effects and aren't quick to jump. I like the cautious approaches. The only part I dislike about coinbase is gdax. It's to simple. Needs more advanced options and to not crash and freeze at peak times of distress in the market. That's when money is either made or lost. And I'm losing more than I should because gdax won't let me in to trade. Unacceptable and needs to be corrected before it can truly be the leader.,5,3

All and all it‚Äôs a wonderful app. It‚Äôs very intuitive and user friendly.

What I hope happens from
here is, in a next update, users will get the option to have that back (while still signed in so as to be able to get their alerts), and if/as they want to drill down into viewing their accounts info, buy/sell or change settings etc., they can do that, optionally after passing the additional, app-specific security verification if enabled (via Passcode, TouchID or FaceID).

Every once in a while you‚Äôll get lucky and buy at the actual listed price,  but they get you there too. They freeze the app after you select ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù and say that ‚Äúthe price has changed‚Äù.

Second customer service was better but still didn‚Äôt help!  Both put tickets in for more support!  Only through email and they said my browser was out of date!  Duh, iPhone 11 with newest browser was not the problem!  
Would never recommend this company!",1,1

They claim I violated their TOS when I have not done anything but watch the price. Now I have to get my refund but my account says I have nothing. It says I have 0.00 BTC because they closed my account before the pending payments went through, even though my bank statement says otherwise. I believe I‚Äôve done nothing illegal and they stole my money. Pending transactions take forever.

This is why crypto goes nowhere because this has never ever happened to my regular investments. Scam scam scam do not download! Do not put your money here ever!!!!

Would like to add their support is terrible and DO NOT BY ANY MEANS PIT YOUR MONEY HERE. If this is the future wait for Fidelity or JP Morgan or a reputable sight to do it with. These crypto companies right now are total scams!",1,1

- Zero human support, bot keeps posting useless solutions that doesn‚Äôt solve my issue
- moving crypto to different wallets is a pain. 72 hour delays
- ID re-verification after passing all other security measures
- trading issues, app is extremely slow or stops working when system is overwhelmed (ath weeks)
- CEO stance on the company‚Äôs mission has significantly changed. Coinbase is now solely for profit hosting other altcoins that have lost 90% value currently
- App is becoming more centralized, no new products that increases user value like Cash App
- bad rep in the btc engineering community

1. When you trade a coin the price quote you see and how much you actually get for is higher. I don‚Äôt know if Coinbase keeps that margin but that‚Äôs definitely hitting my pocket.
2. The trading fees is really expensive
3. The last couple orb updates has messed up the view. For example, if you go in and out of any coin it goes back to one year price performance whereas to earlier if you select at 1 day / 1 week it would stay like that.
Coinbase should definitely look into this issue and address it.",3,3

I wish there was a way to see how much growth you have made on what you have purchased right now I am going by pen and paper and I wish the fees were added after what you purchased.

This is the most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve ever heard! I‚Äôm a professional trader and investor and your I.D. being up to date is NOT an issue ANYWHERE. So, bye bye. Also, what type of criminal organization charges 3% turn around cost? You can tell that children are your private market because kids don‚Äôt evaluate cost. This exploration of crypto through coin base was invaluable because I can see that the fall is going to be tremendous. The real drop in process hasn‚Äôt even begun.",1,1
2021-12-05,"The UX experience is clunky and a lot of the time if I want to find a feature I have to use google to figure out where it‚Äôs tucked away. That being said their documentation also seems to be out of date in some areas because it mentions tabs and menus that don‚Äôt exist or are called something different despite being the listed guide for iOS. 

I‚Äôm still unable to find the ‚ÄòScan QR‚Äô function which is actually required to connect to Coinbase‚Äôs own web extension. I guess if you‚Äôre an iOS user this function doesn‚Äôt exist?",2,2
2021-04-28,"This is the first time using any sort of investment app, I downloaded it because I heard they gave you a reward. Well at first they didn‚Äôt give me my rewards they promised ( I wasn‚Äôt mad ) until yesterday...which is about a week later.  I‚Äôve actually been making a few dollars on this app, it‚Äôs sort of like a addictive game to me now. The reward they promised might not have been instantaneous but they kept their word for me and provided it. Thanks Coinbase for creating an easy to use app for simple people such as myself lol. 

P.S 
Yes they charge small transaction fees for deposits and withdrawals. (You‚Äôll make it back if you‚Äôre smart)

Moving from one crypto currency to another is completely free though.",5,5
2021-08-15,"Do not believe their promo of getting $5 of free Bitcoin. It‚Äôs a gimmick and they won‚Äôt pay you. I jumped through all their hoops, gave them the information they requested, and waited. I opened two support tickets to get them to research. Both times I‚Äôm told that I need to complete all the steps or that my account has been flagged as a spam account. I reply both times with screenshots of proof of completion and that I‚Äôm real, and both times no response and a week later the ticket is closed. This app might be convenient to buy crypto, but spend your money elsewhere. The fees are probably less other places.",1,1
2021-06-17,The app has a good interface. Easy to navigate. But the only real problem I have is a real big one. Is that when coins prices are low. It only allows you to buy a vary small amount. We‚Äôre when the prices are high it lets you buy as much as you want.  I was buying Bitcoin and when it hit 36k it would let me buy up to 400$ worth. The next day the price dropped to 31k and I wanted to buy. But the app would only let me buy 4$ worth. This app won‚Äôt let you make money. So go somewhere else if you want to buy and trade crypto!,2,3
2021-04-14,"Coinbase is a well developed app and easy to use. I‚Äôm fairly new to this app, it‚Äôs about my first week. I already understand how to buy sell convert or trade. Very simple.

Other than that I only know how this works to that extent. Without the videos to teach the info I don‚Äôt understand any further",5,4
2021-02-13,Cannot use this app. Coinbase me to log into bank account and then CoinBase told me because I have 2 factor authentication with my bank account (which is a very good security measure to prevent hackers) they cannot accept money from my account.

An okay way to buy and sell crypto. however they promise 10$ in bitcoin if you refer someone who signs up for coinbase and spends it least 100$ , I‚Äùbe referred 2 people who have spend 100+$ and I‚Äôve never been awarded the BTC. Also it took them 30+ days to respond to my multiple emails, and in their response they basically just said they aren‚Äôt liable and they‚Äôre not sure why I didn‚Äôt get it sorry.

This app puts so much friction between you and your assets it is hard to believe it exists for any purpose other than for the owners to simply skim off your capital. A bunch of s--t happens off blockchain because it's cheaper and easier for them, but they're still going to charge you a fee and good luck getting a hash etc. And hey if you ever dare to reach out to them for support they'll will be either dismissive, confused, or just not reply at all.

Longer time frame to view on coins so when you click ‚Äúall‚Äù it goes back to when that coin opened on the market 

Adding coins to be traded earlier. This issue is big to me because it seems coins get added due to popularity causing the investor to potentially miss an opportunity to invest early on. 

Last thing which isn‚Äôt a bad issue at all, subjective really but it‚Äôd be a nice touch. On the ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù tab, if it displayed all of your current investments up top so you wouldn‚Äôt have to scroll through to the ones you actually have put money into.

2020-11-28,"As this app can chart what the dollar and percentage rise and fall of the market is, and also the dollar rise and fall of your initial investment, I found it odd that it doesn‚Äôt provide certain information about your initial investment, like what percentage your investment has grown or shrunk since your initial buy, or what percentage over or under the day-1 opening coin price (when it was first put on the market) your purchase was made. Otherwise, no complaints. Good work",4,4

Coinbase closed my account and will not give me a reason why. I‚Äôm not a bad person. I serve in the United States Marine Corps. We get paid $20k per year and I was using Coinbase as a way to supplement my income by trading.

Coinbase locked my price in on 4Jan but the cost of bitcoin is going down significantly. Coinbase obviously has no incentive to provide me bitcoin as each day they make more money off my money.

Lately, it‚Äôs been the latter. Very unreliable. The only reason I use them is for card and PayPal support. 
Also for a solid two weeks recently, the fees were ridiculous. Example- $9 to send $20. 
They need to step up. Stop taking new customers if you can‚Äôt handle the traffic or roll out new currencies to older customers in groups so the blockchain doesn‚Äôt get hit all at once. Common sense. 1 Star for card use, 1 star for PayPal.",2,1

The only reasons I didn't give it a 5 star are the low transaction limits and the fact that you can't get credited funds during bank transfer.

2022-01-17,"Pro‚Äôs
- Good access to a wide range of crypto currencies.  Other platforms like Gemini have a much more limited selection of crypto.
- Easy to use and easy to transfer funds
- Good education 
- Provides more transparency on the transaction details than other platforms like Gemini

Con‚Äôs
- This is a big one: I made a trade when a coin I wanted reached a certain low.  Coinbase made the trade at greater than $1.00 than was possible according chart at the time of my trade. So not only did I get charged $7.34 for the trade, but some how they also arbitraged more $1 off of my trade point. They need to implement at Limit Price type trading system that all equity retail platforms offer (eg., Robinhood etc). This is a key piece of transparency they need to create. The experience I had above creates mistrust.
- High transaction fees per trade",3,4

After letting coinbase know the situation I've been ghosted. Not a single response in 10 days now. Lost 60,000,000 shiba inu coins that was right around $3,000 at the time. Beyond frustrating, I do not recommend this app at all",1,1

It isn‚Äôt possible to open a ticket for wrong account balance so you have to open it as something close.

2021-02-08,What is up with this new update? It‚Äôs like it went backwards. Most apps get more modern with updates. But this most recent layout change is awful. Why did you guys take away the day line graphs next to each currency in the watchlist? This was an easy way to see which coins had performed well next to each other rather than having to click on each coin individually. Whoever gave the green light for the recent design layout should be fired. I have no idea how they believed that it would make the app look better. It makes it look and feel cheap and it‚Äôs is more work for me when checking how the coins have performed recently.,1,2
2021-02-05,"As some reviews have said, stay far far away from Coinbase. Their fees are so high that they will eat up a pretty percentage of your gains when you buy and sell.

You cannot carry out basic stop losses or set up orders.. so you have to look out for push alerts or constantly checkthe app to see when your coin has hit a desired price.

This is a major problem and pretty sad that there's not a number to talk to someone (human) considering how much money is being traded on this site. You would think you could talk to someone when issues arise. 

I know many other people who trade on coinbase who feel the exact same way.

However, the fees are just to high compare to other platforms that charges way less. Every time I want to purchase a coin, or add to my pre-existing coins, I am getting hit with the same volume of price without considerations for recurring buys on the same coin. This is not fair for small investors who are trying to break into the markets. 

I would hope that the board can review this concern and lower their fees for beginners and/or for those who are still trading and buying coins under $20,000. Beyond that it‚Äôs fair game because if ones can afford to spend 20k or have an account that‚Äôs worth 20k or more than the current fees will be appropriately applied. 

Please revisit fees for those making under 20k.

I cannot trade them within this platform to gain financially. I will always be one step behind.

To make matters worse, there is no human support to help resolve bugs and other issues.  They expect you to resolve all of your issues with FAQ and a chat bot.

Let‚Äôs say I buy $20, that‚Äôs my initial investment 
So, I would like to see my original amount [$20] invested and then be shown the amount it‚Äôs at [$X] in addition to how much I‚Äôve lost or gained [+/-$X] from my initial investment. 
I have no idea if that‚Äôs something anyone else would be interested in seeing but I would like that very much please!

2021-09-28,"If you sell your Bitcon, Coinbase will charge you with hefty withdrawal fees ($150 for a $35k cash after selling a BTC). This is in addition to their fees for trading Bitcoin. So you have to pay that extra fees to get your own money out!

Secondly, you cannot use your own existing g cash in Coinbase to buy additional Bitcoin. If you want to buy another Bitcoin, they will get the needed cash from your linked bank account, instead of using the existing cash in your Coinbase account. And then they will again charge you for getting it out when you sell the Bitcoins.

All in all, they charge you for every transaction except putting your money into their appüòänot surprising at all! But there is a still space for another Bitcoin app, which will charge users rationally. 

Are you listening, PayPal ?",3,1

Unreliable and customer service is a joke over a week without a response. GIVE ME MY MONEY!!!!!!,5,1
2021-09-03,I like this app but when you click on each crypto you should be able to see the gains you are currently holding. I truly do not understand why they don‚Äôt do that. I like how Robinhood has that. At the end of the day the whole point of this is to grow money and you should be able to have a more in depth picture of how it‚Äôs working for you,4,4
2021-07-26,"For an experience, I bought $250 worth Bitcoin when the price was low at around $34k and sold it @$36k, but made no profit at all. 

Because of: 
- Super expensive fees: you are charged a fee when you buy coins and sell them back and they are ridiculously high
- Big ‚Äúspread‚Äù: Coin prices are Higher than actual market price when you buy them and lower than actual market price when you sell them. in other words Coinbase makes profit out of your transaction in addition to the percentage fees, which are already high.
- To withdraw your money you have to wait almost a week. They say it is to prevent the fraud activities. But putting money into their account is immediate.
- They want your bank account login and password via Plaid, so you have to disclose your actual e-banking credentials.",3,1
2021-07-25,The app is overall simple to get used to and the educational videos help out tremendously. The only major fall back is Coinbase does not keep track of your profits or losses . You need to keep track of how much you invested and whether or not you lost or gained from your investment. I thought this would have been a standard feature but it‚Äôs not. This would really setup  Coinbase to be a more robust investment tool and would keep more of its clientele for the long term.,3,4

I WISH they had a feature like Robinhood (and maybe other apps, idk) where it shows your net gain/loss instead of me trying to remember ever point I purchased at to monitor that.

2021-03-11,"This app is great to introduce people to crypto and to get them buying and selling quickly.  A couple drawbacks:  

For me in particular, I don‚Äôt have much extra investing money, and I‚Äôm more interested in playing the short game to compound my gains.  Not having a lot of $$ and buying/selling frequently for me means I need to be on my A game to make decent money beyond the Coinbase transaction fees (I‚Äôm in the USA, so the fee structure will be different for different countries).  

Other than that, I think more could be done in terms of personal record keeping.  You can‚Äôt see when you bought each coin (and for how much) without drilling into the graph and estimating.  There are also a couple coins I wanted to buy, but I can only track them on this app, I can‚Äôt trade them.

2020-09-16,These morons that own this company will allow your account to be drained by a third party. They apparently are too stupid to understand that when someone goes into your account and does a password change and then immediately liquidates the entire account that there‚Äôs not fraud going on. I was the victim of a commonly used tactic called a sim swap hack and this is something that has been a problem for this company but they have made zero effort to fix it.

If you search the web you‚Äôll find many poor reviews stating how they‚Äôre crooks.

Then afterwards said they would not shorten the 30 day hold period. THIRTY DAYS. An entire month to use my coin when they took the money from my bank account.

I reached out to Coinbase several times for why they hold my purchased coins for 30 days with my USD deposited via my linked bank account and bank approved transaction. It is solely on Coinbase end holding the coin for free trade. This. Is. Insane. 30 days. Gave a star so as to leave this comment. Yes.

However, there are a couple of areas that could use improvement.

First, it would be nice to have the same historical wallet transfer functionality, which exists on the site but not on the app.

.25-$3.+ spread fee trading one crypto to another.

0 fee to sell to USD along with 0 fee to use it after the sell to buy other crypto.

The underlying prices did not change enough within those 20 seconds to justify losing 2% of the entire investment right off the bat.

2021-10-29,Don use it they steal your money when you do a conversion they miss lead the users by saying zero fees to do a transfer but if you sell they will sell your crypto at a lower price and the price of the cypto you sell has not change. And the same way around when you buy you buy it at a higher price then you lose money,5,1

The features are similar if not identical to competing US-based platforms which do offer support.
Crypto investing is a new journey for many that can be stressful at times. Excluding any type of support (no chat support, email, technical troubleshooting, etc.) is a bad CX. CoinBase allow themselves to do this because of their market dominance at this time.
I hope they put their customers in the center and provide some sort of support in the future. God knows they can afford it.",1,1

I checked everything and I‚Äôm sure that no one has access to my email nor my phone. I‚Äôm very careful and well protected from online scams, but was not suspicious about using app of Coinbase.

The app is not only glitching causing balances to show as zero and graphs to show as a dollar each time I log in but also today when I tried to transfer a small amount of ethereum at a specific address the transaction was passed 2 times?!? And I had to pay for the fees twice? I mean I already moved to Binance which is levels above this but just for simple stuff like that? Amazing. 

Oh by the way customer service is amazingly non existent.

2021-01-20,"The good: this app is easy to use and does make it trivial to buy, sell, and trade crypto. Kudos to coinbase for making it so easy.

The bad: there is no way to specify a position when buying or selling. You're left to whatever nonsense the instant options provide you, meaning if your crypto of choice is skyrocketing you can only sell at whatever price Coinbase can instantly trade at. Over time, this leads to significant gaps in profitability. 

There are far better trading resources out there than this forced, poor leveraging convenience - not to mention the arbitrarily and absurdly high requirements for confirmations on incoming transactions. Pick a different app.",1,2

Read reviews on web, not only here. 
As much as Coinbase is trying to shoot for a high profile investor ,and be user friendly app - none of that can be achieved without a decent customer support. There‚Äôs no rocket science behind a successful start up and successful business, but satisfied clients. Best thing about unsatisfied clients - class action lawsuits! So keep being cheap Coinbase :)",1,5

This is something new that‚Äôs happening in Oct 2020 so if you‚Äôve had this app already it might not affect you. Anyone new to crypto trading, avoid this app. They are making you jump thru hoops with verifying your id by asking to provide license bank info etc but are selling it to scammers. It‚Äôs not every download but one out of every ten or so and I was unlucky I guess. Any other app will be a better choice than this one. Don‚Äôt take your chance.

There are really good secure services out there that charge a fraction of their fees.  For example, if you are a trader on Coinbase Pro and trade $45,000 a month the first 0.70% goes to Coinbase.  You are fronting the money, taking the investment risk and if you are lucky enough to score a 1.4% gain, Coinbase is going to take half.  I think that is ridiculous.

Now you have to manually add up your wallet‚Äôs values to see the total value of your portfolio.

2017-12-20,If you‚Äôre new to crypto this is likely where you‚Äôll find yourself. I do warn any new person to stay far away from this app/website. You will be paying a ridiculous premium on any coins you purchase and when trying to sell they‚Äôll set the price much lower than what the coin actually is. Coinbase is profiting from providing false/inaccurate data. There are other alternatives out there with better security. They will also Kiley be facing legal action in the near future due to some terribly unethical actions. I enjoyed my time here while it lasted but have moved all coins off this and have deleted me account as of this morning.,1,1
2017-12-20,The purpose of Coinbase is to allow easy and quick transaction for people not familiar with cryptocurrency. The downtime and the hoops you have to jump through are getting worse and worse with this app. Expect to run into at least a few problems when using this app. I haven‚Äôt tried any others so I cannot compare. With as much as they are charging they can provide a better platform and better customer service. Coinbase is making an obscene amount of money they need to reciprocate with an A++ user experience. No more apologies Coinbase,2,2

They also dropped it right before a difficulty increase on Bitcoin, which makes this a coordinated attack orchestrated by Brian Armstrong and Roger Ver. I can no longer support this extremely unethical behavior by Coinbase and will be closing my account immediately.

I don‚Äôt understand what is going on why I‚Äôm now having to wait so long when you‚Äôve taken my money already. I‚Äôm worse than that there‚Äôs no way to talk to anybody about it.

A month ago this was a five star app as of today one star.",1,1
2017-12-20,"I‚Äôve been using coinbase for over a year, and it was never too reliable, frequent crashes during high volume trading and customer support that replied days later if at all. But recently coinbase has tried to manipulate the cryptocurrency market in its own favor and hoped no one would notice. It listed a new coin, Bitcoin Cash, months after other exchanges had already and upon listing it for purchase, fabricated the price to thousands above what it was currently trading at and what it had been trading for months. This move was an obvious ploy to try and artificially pump the price of the coin and could cost people millions if they are uninformed.",1,1
2022-12-23,User friendly. Simplifies transactions/cash outs with an advanced platform for experienced users. Has the history of being a stable & trusted company. Worry of major mishaps is low imo. Transactions are always immediate & no fees. Never had a problem here. Great platform from multiples I‚Äôve worked with. Coinbase is here to stay. Solid company.,5,5
2017-11-28,"When it was working, it wouldn‚Äôt let me spend more even when I hadn‚Äôt hit my limit, telling me that I had hit my limit. Pretty sure it‚Äôs a bug, otherwise the message needs to be more clear. Also the fees are high.
My main issue: it kicked me off after 3 days! I definitely didn‚Äôt violate any of the terms, and after calling they said it probably thought I was underage (I‚Äôm over 21). So now I lost all my transactions, and it‚Äôs taken several days to fix. I switched to Gemini and have been happy ever since. Their fees are also about a tenth of Coinbase‚Äôs, and Gemini has much better customer service.",1,2
2017-10-04,"I had been using this app for a few months, and everything was fine until about a week ago, when a transaction was canceled without explanation and my account status changed to ""restricted"". From then it's been nothing but trouble. As far as I can tell they don't actually have any human-staffed customer service. The email address just gets you a link to a very unhelpful chatbot, which says it doesn't know what to do and gives you a link that goes--back to the chatbot! So my account is stuck, with no obvious way to fix it, and no recourse other than talking to this dumb bot. Thumbs down.",1,1
2021-11-12,"After being hacked and losing all my crypto. Cb will not take responsibility, although they‚Äôve admitted they have a two factor security flaw. Buyer beware.

Keep your money under a mattress.  It‚Äôs safer.",5,1
2022-08-16,"I enjoyed using the crypto trading app very fondly over the past couple years. Then my account got hacked. I have had no communication back from Coinbase‚Äôs customer service team after i received an email months ago informing me my account preferred phone number had been changed. I now have had no access to the account for over 3 months. 

Something needs to be done to make this right and ensured that it does not happen to anyone else with a decent amount of money invested in crypto‚Ä¶.i guess that‚Äôs why I use Uphold now‚Ä¶. much better app¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",1,1
2022-06-21,"I‚Äôve had Coinbase a few months now and I‚Äôm writing a review in hopes the developers actually see this and work to improve the app. Overall, this app makes it very easy to buy crypto. Very simple app to use. The app needs better graphs, profit/loss for each asset you have, and lower fees.  For the amount of money I give this app, there should be more tools and statistics regarding the crypto you buy. They say they want to ‚Äúteach‚Äù the investor about crypto? Show more information and numbers so there isn‚Äôt any guessing.",2,4
2022-05-09,"Thought i‚Äôd give this a shot on being one of my wallets after seeing so much advertising. But they Charge fees for Deposits, And Fees for withdrawals, not only that there is Fees for Transfer of Wallets. and Not only that you have to wait 10 days from your initial deposit before you can even transfer between wallets. If i would have known of this before purchase i would have never made it, app needs to be more clear of there cash grab. way more apps out there that would be best for you and less fees and that are more transparent with its users.",1,2
2022-04-03,"This is literally the worst most god awful app ever. I can never access my funds every single time I try to even look at my portfolio it says that it‚Äôs having connection issues, which is clearly not the case because I‚Äôve done thisAdd variety of settings and times, plus all of my other apps and data is working just fine.

I have tried to contact their support and no one will respond, they have over $1000 of my moneyThat I can‚Äôt even look at let alone sell or send to my wallet. Please avoid this app at all costs. Look into other exchanges",1,1
2022-03-08,"A friend told me that this is the best to trade, sell and trade with people. How wrong this friend was. I would give this app one star but unfortunately people don‚Äôt look at the one star reviews and the company will delete the low reviews. As soon I get my money back I will disconnect my bank and any other links I have with coinbase. The wait is long, not like a few days more like a week at best. Don‚Äôt use this application if you want to try Crypto. When Crypto crashes and it will soon I will celebrating like no tomorrow.",2,1
2022-01-01,"I literally used this app for 3 months straight trying to get verified and each time I submit my ID. Despite not having any issue with my IDs with other brokerages, Coinbase would not verify. It became a hassle to even verify my information as I read articles on changing and submitting changes to my account. 

I had been waitlisted for crypto and even then the app had problems waitlisting me despite spending hours watching every video all the way through. A truly unpleasant experience. 

Finally after 3 months of waiting for my ID to be submit, and refusal to resubmit my ID once more, I decided to deactivate my account. I am very certain all information I provided is correct and filled out thoroughly. I am also disappointed in how much time I wasted patiently waiting for my account to be verified. 

I did call at some point yet, I found the call waiting times were far too long.",1,1
2021-12-30,Coinbase is typically great and is my go to for crypto trading. But recently the app keeps logging me out and it's starting to become frustrating. It happens pretty much every day now. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I'm on the latest version iOS and I have an iPhone 12 pro so my hardware is pretty new. I'm going to have to put my review score at a 2 until they remedy this issue.,4,2
2021-11-28,I‚Äôm not taking my losses out on Coinbase. I know nothing about stocks let alone crypto so losses are my fault. But the minimal gains I made were erased after the fees to purchase and then sell each crypto. Maybe it‚Äôs a bit more worth it to invest a large amount of money so the fees are as effective on your gains but it‚Äôs ridiculous how many times fees are taken from you. I also thought the app itself wasn‚Äôt as easy to navigate as a similar app like Robinhood is. It‚Äôs nothing complicated but I feel like things could have been simplified.,2,2
2021-11-16,"DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP! They stole my money! 

There was some issue where I could not add money to my account, so I uninstalled and reinstalled. Upon reinstalling, all of my investments and money were gone. I filed TWO help tickets to try and have the issue fixed and on BOTH tickets they just closed the case without any updates and without returning my investments. I provided proof that my money was invested and that it was never withdrawn, and it‚Äôs still the way I was treated. I will be filing the case with the BBB and possibly be seeking legal action as well, due to the theft. 

DO NOT INSTALL! Find a better way to invest in crypto.",1,1
2021-11-10,"I‚Äôve made multiple trades where somehow someway they‚Äôve taken cash I sent in from my bank and frozen it.  I currently have about $300 positive in my wallet from trades over $1,000 that are just frozen.  If you plan on trading or shopping with anything over $900 be prepared to have your funds frozen-FOR WEEKS otherwise yea it works well as far as informative and user friendly (aside from stealing/holding your $ hostage) its great on small buys m, shopping transfers it rocks, customer service is somewhat non-existent on these fronts as well.",2,3
2021-08-20,"I had a hard time finding out how much money my investment has gained or lost and the percentage. It maybe due to my unfamiliarity with the tool. However, that only confirmed to me that it's not user friendly enough. The basics of user interface design is a clear dashboard or landing page that can be customized and the most used features are accessible with inky one click. It should be designed in such a way that even a new user can quickly know how to navigate.",2,2
2021-05-11,Easy to navigate. Easy to make purchases.  Love the simple to understand descriptions on the different cryptos offered.  Appreciate the ability to separate the list of only those currencies available on coinbase when looking to trade.  Also love the ability to earn coins based on watching info videos.,5,4
2021-07-10,"Says to come back later every time I try to sign in. If I can‚Äôt even use the app, why?? I have a Coinbase and a Coinbase wallet account and all I want to do is connect those 2 but the app won‚Äôt let me sign in. I can sign into the website wallet via laptop. I can see my money there but I can‚Äôt get my $$ from my (DeFi?) wallet to the app wallet (¬ø). It‚Äôs been days of the app telling me to come back later when I try to sign in. When exactly do you want me to come back? Make the app work. What I‚Äôm trying to do is time sensitive and I haven‚Äôt heard back from customer support.",1,1
2021-05-22,"I was using Voyager and the app was fast, responsive, and lag-free. Unfortunately, for some reason unbeknownst to me, all my deposits got declined and I had to try a different crypto exchange.  Coinbase has great reviews on the App Store, but in my case, I find it extremely laggy. And I have an iPhone 12 Pro, so there's no excuse. Unfortunately, I have to stick with Coinbase for now, but I hope the developers fix it and make it faster and more responsive.  I do like the videos to earn free crypto, that was a nice touch.",2,3
2021-05-17,"Downloaded the app and it never worked. Every time I tried to sign in it would just say ‚ÄúConnection trouble, try again later.‚Äù I would try again, quit the app and try again, it never worked. 

I had it downloaded on my phone for a few weeks and ever time I tried signing in it was ALWAYS connection trouble. I deleted and redownloaded it and it was just more of the same. 

I‚Äôve NEVER had an app work so poorly. The other million reviews here must be fake or something. Day or night, it never friggen worked. Unbelievable!",1,1
2021-05-12,"I love the app and the ability to buy and withdraw instantly, the fees are alittle high and they don‚Äôt hold dogecoin but Gemini does. I think it has to do with their API but the main issue I‚Äôm having is the HUGE Lag that I‚Äôm getting in the app. I have very high speed internet and the app has been very slow and kind of annoying that I have to leave my phone and go to a computer. 

Please fix this‚Ä¶ and add dogecoin.",4,4
2019-08-21,"I have loved Coinbase since the moment I started using it. I love being able to earn free crypto just for spending less than 10 min of my time learning about each different crypto, and then being able to refer friends to make more money while they make money.

So to my shocking surprise I‚Äôve more then doubled my $ I put in but now what ? It just disappears? I sent them a screenshot of April 5th where it shows $961 and I have plenty of bank statements showing where I gave Coinbase plenty of $ to buy crypto. So if there was a negative star it would have to be in the negatives now.. they really need to resolve this issue.!.!  I don‚Äôt do well with thief‚Äôs or scammers",1,1
2021-04-02,"Coinbase is a great standard to use to invest and watch the movement of digital assets. 
Other than the fact that I have repeatedly said that this app needs to bring back pricing alerts that you can manually set yourself and the difficulties I have experienced with the vaults, I believe this to be one of the top three apps for crypto investment, at least from a beginner to moderate-level user.",4,5

I‚Äôve tried during normal banking business hours, no luck. I called my bank and they said there is no block on the transfers, it must be an issue with Coinbase. There‚Äôs no phone number to call support at Coinbase, does a phone number even exist? The transfers that I was able to make with my debit card incurred hefty fees. And funds are limited to $750/ week. Has anyone else been experiencing the same problems?",1,1

Also, I‚Äôve sent the company about 3 forum requests due to their issues and have no responded to me once. Terrible service. Use to operate smooth and efficiently.

2019-04-25,"I wanted to do a bitcoin run to learn the process- used Coinbase since the word on the street was that that‚Äôs the app to use.
I‚Äôm not an expert, and I guess the high fee of almost $15 per transaction (plus lower conversion rate) is the price you have to pay. What really threw me off and, upset me is this whole process of ‚Äúholding your funds‚Äù thing. Why?! It took them days to even release my money, now it takes another 5 days to transfer it back to my account?? No, guys. Money can be transferred within minutes, there is no reason to hold my funds for one week. It smells fishy, using my $$. I‚Äôm back to regular stocks.",1,1

I would have bought and sold a lot more crypto currencies by now, but since I can‚Äôt really do anything about limit orders, I am a lot more hesitant - because I can‚Äôt sit at my computer/phone all day and only do that. 

Please help with ID verification, so I can actually begin trading!! Thanks guys.",3,5
2017-12-26,"I‚Äôve had nothing but bad experience with Coinbase. 

- You have to verify your identity to do ANYTHING

- Verification is a joke. Submitted my California ID 3 times and it comes as ‚ÄòID unreadable‚Äô, ‚ÄòFailed response status‚Äô, etc

- Transactions remain pending for more than 2 weeks even if you‚Äôre verified

- Charge you twice for the same transaction

- There‚Äôs a $1 charge on every transactions AND they try to hide it from you

- Live chat is just a bot who keeps repeating the same thing over and over

- Calling customer support line will only help you setup and FAQ‚Äôs aka sell their stuff to you

- Customer support line is nowhere to be found in the app. They try to hide it from you. You have to google their customer support

- If you have ANY issues with your account or Coinbase, well f you, go to the support page and ‚Äòsubmit a ticket‚Äô. And they‚Äôll respond at their leisure. Maybe in a month.",2,1
2017-12-22,Do not Coinbase if you want good customer service and access at all times to your money. They consistently block users from selling or buying during times of high volatility and recently had a monumental case of insider trading when they listed BCH. Do you're homework and read reddit reviews to get the real story. Do not trust the glowing five star reviews they pay keyboard monkeys overseas to write so that more people use their subpar and highly unreliable/unprofessional exchange. I cannot stress enough the dangers of using this exchange. People have literally lost thousands of dollars by not being able to access their funds. You have been warned!,1,1

After I realized the bot was no help, I contacted them through their support email. They literally emailed me a day later stating I was violating their regulations, they gave no details or valid reasons. It seems as they don‚Äôt even care for their clients cause their volume you want to be safe don‚Äôt follow the herd, the worst part is they don‚Äôt even want to help me.",1,1
2017-12-03,"I‚Äôve been using this app for about a week now. They don‚Äôt send me notifications unless I specifically set an alert so that is perfect. Most of everything is self explanatory, but it would be great if they had a little ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù tab to play around with some graph filters or to see more timelines. This is incredibly easy to use and I applaud the creators, but it‚Äôs almost to the point of being too dumbed down and leaves me wanting more. Great app",4,4
2017-09-13,"Stable and functional. There are a couple of things that could improve it, but it gets the job done and is great for quickly checking and buying. 

Improvements? Show a total of all wallets. Drag a finger across charts to show the historical price in the past.  Those are things on the desktop version. 

Improved charting - I miss MACD, Bollinger bands, etc. but maybe that should be held over for GDAX",5,4

I sent the customer service team a photo of my purchase summary, providing proof that it was missing information and how I incurred additional fees because of it. 

And the customer service team has no other way of helping beyond copy and pasting their terms and agreements to customers. 

They also are completely unable to refund any fees regardless of the reason, apparently. 

I could understand if it was just what I ‚Äúthought‚Äù happened, but I have physical proof of an issue and they just ignored it.
