2024-03-04 06:24:10,"It's ok and has plenty of features but the layout is broken for UK users. When in Advanced mode viewing a pair, the Buy/Sell banner at the bottom of the screen covers the history section and you're not able to scroll down easily unless you use a very small area of the screen. I think this hasn't been addressed since the blue warning banner was added, pushing everything down. It's also really frustrating that this warning can't be dismissed as it permanently takes up a fifth of the view."
2024-03-15 23:33:20,"This app was fine when I first used it but for over a month now, I can't sign in. I have unistalled and reinstalled it countless times, I have cleared the cache, I have tried everything and all I get as a reward is an infuriating blue spinning wheel. This is a ludicrous joke of an app! It took another app update to fix this problem but since then everything has been OK, touch wood."
2024-03-09 07:19:18,"They have the worst customer service ever. They asked me to update my address but they are too busy to review my update or submitted documents. So they froze my account until my turn comes! And I have been waiting months! There is no one to talk to since they don’t take calls from outside the US or from my territory. As for the app, I don't understand why it doesn't give the unit cost per coin based on my transaction history. They also don't post the profit or loss for account or the trading."
2024-03-16 18:45:31,"The something wrong with the proof of address check. I'm submitting multiple types of documents with the address present . And its being rejected. Update: If there was a lower score than one, I would give it. After finally managing the proof of address, it seems I cannot cash out, because my account is not eligible to hold a cash balance, for whatever reason. 2 hours wasted on speking customer support and nobody can do anything about it. I can buy with credit card or PayPal , but I no sell."
2023-12-16 10:11:13,"Good phone app. However: 1. App only displays dates in the illogical and confused US date format (MM/DD/YYYY). It would be greatly improved if you offered the option to display dates in the far more logical UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY), in which the units displayed get progressively larger as you move to the right. This simple improvement should be extremely easy for you to implement. 2. Warning at the top of all pages is irritating, though I appreciate this is imposed on you by the state."
2024-01-09 18:11:56,"Poor log in. I do like coinbase, never had a problem before. However, I've have numerous times of trying to log in. I've passed all the verification and texts, 2-steps, you name it, I've done it. It still will not let me log in. It just buffers when using the login button, or it suddenly says login cancelled. Please coinbase can you sort this out, I don't want to take my business elsewhere, but I feel I may have to."
2024-01-10 18:38:17,"Still can't take a photo to verify the web3 wallet, cos due to the blue warning message at the top you can't actually see the take photo button at the bottom of the screen. The app is good but support is bad. And for a financial business app support is crucial... il update rating when they fix the photo verification bug."
2024-04-15 12:06:57,"I have several issues: 1. I can no longer see my all-time balances, which has now slowed me down because I have to click each assest individually; 2. the app now makes us switch to Advanced for spot trades, but you can't see your other holdings, whereas before everything was in one place, and 3. I can't apply for the USDC crypto card. It will not allow me to put in my address or mailing address. I tried using my desktop as well. Customer service was of no help at all. Not as user friendly."
2024-04-14 20:25:25,"It is impossible to place a trade using the Advanced Trade feature. The latency is so bad that the app just locks up whenever attempting to interact with the Buy or Sell page. I choose market order, and after a great deal of lag (over 3 minutes), the market order page displays. Then, when I try to type in the dollar amount I would like to sell or purchase, there is another few minutes of lag before the keyboard interface even displays. Then it freezes altogether. It's been like this for months."
2024-04-12 13:59:12,"Love the cancel all transactions (orders). Dont like that you can not turn phone sideways to see graph of BTC for example. Fees are high. Very fast and responsive. Love that in portfolio view you can see which coins are in the green and red, it would be better inprovement to see how much % they went up or down. In the spot menu it would be nice to see what price you bought something without going the extra step to order history. Sell all coins would be nice feature if market takes a nose dive."
2024-04-13 02:48:27,"The app is a little confusing to use now that it changed slightly. But, it updates transactions quickly. It only tells you your purchase amount using the debit card, not where you shopped. Crypto is easy to buy and the rates are all listed to help you make a decision. I wish it gave a warning when it your balance is low. It us easy to transfer money into your account. I like the learn section if the app."
2024-04-11 04:21:10,"I can't sign in. The app on first launch gives you an intro screen to either open an account, browse, or up in the top corner, to sign in. Upon selecting the option to sign in, it opens an in-app browser which takes you to the coinbase website to sign in. I've jumped through all the hoops several times, verifying, with glitches galore like multiple sent requests, to use an email link to verify. Once that actually works, you get a spinning wheel of death. Long story short, I can't sing into app."
2024-04-15 02:25:05,"Was fantastic for the longest time, but now, charts are broken, and has been since the crash on March 12th or 13th. Hasn't corrected in over a month now, also, decimal errors all the time, inconsistent interface with %s. Fix my charts and i'd fix my rating. I have uninstalled/reinstalled to no avail."
2024-04-07 15:51:39,"Over time I have noticed features are slowly disappearing from the free version of the app. I feel like they're slowly pushing everyone to pay so they can see all the things that used to be free. I love this app and I have used it as my main investing platform but I don't like that they're taking away from those of us who aren't looking to spend unnecessarily on a paid version when it's impractical. I miss seeing my ""All time"" balance for my assets, which was a new draw back, and others gone too"
2024-04-15 15:37:09,"I always have to verify my identity, I could only buy not sell. it took way to long, months for help in customer support. they also have no number to call for any support. and only gibe you 7 minutes to respond when they and texting you back. and always shut off when you are trying to send the pictures to verify. it is very unreasonab length of time to navigate the things they are asking from you. I would never reccomend this platform."
2024-04-10 08:10:54,"I like the earlier versions of Coinbase a lot better actually. They weren't nearly as reliant on the influence, use or interfacing of other connected platforms. One stop one shop is more my theory. If it is connected and does something great, awesome, doesn't mean I want to have to interface and have to learn everybody new platforms just to move and keep my money secure while earning all potential profits available to me at every moment. Calculate and make and trade for those moments."
2024-04-16 05:34:39,"Congratulations Coinbase on for years running, having the worst customer support I've ever experienced. $200+ in fees paid already, yet 2 months waiting to resolve the issue caused by your systems- preventing me from being able to send my assets to my wallet or buy anything else. Wish I could explain the issue on this review but only 500 characters. I'd just recommend to everyone, stay far, far away from this exchange. Nice interface but wow, 8 customer support exchanges and still unresolved."
2024-04-15 16:25:16,"*** updated review | apr 2024 *** Many changes to improve UI appreciated, but app nearly unusuable for real investment management due to long data load times. I have to use a separate app to track prices, and often times my trades will time out. Dont blame the network, either... it happens everywhere, and on multiple sevices. ********************************** Works well enough. Some minor UI frustrations, limited reporting, etc. Overall good but plenty of room to grow still as well."
2024-03-08 05:00:22,"TNT: Hello all again, I am rating on the latest installment of quest, it is with out a doubt really nice to be able to complete them but I can't and haven't been. I was able to start them but not finish them. I get it, you squad is adding all kinds of new features, and different ways to interact with the wallet. But, whenever y'all get time to fix this issue I'd greatly appreciate it. Oh, and it's been, almost six months, that this has been happening. Hoping it would gotten fixed🤔."
2024-03-14 23:14:43,"The structure of your data changes without explanation: Under 'My Assets,' I like to see the gain or loss percentage accompanied by the current price. Now (and this has happened several times), I see the balance I own of each coin and the quantity of coins. This appears to change on a whim and is not an option in the settings. When it changes this way, I have to select each asset to see if I have lost or gained. It was nice to see, at a glance, the current condition of the market."
2024-02-19 23:15:20,"Great app, but the latest update is atrocious. It's a classic case of fixing something that was not broken and ending up with a worse product for no reason. Taking away the advanced trade and making it standalone makes 0 sense and just makes the app tedious for no reason. It was perfect before but you had to ""fix"" it. Change it back immediately. STOP RELEASING UPDATES FOR THE SAKE OF UPDATES. Every time I open the app now it comes up with that stupid box to change views from advanced to regular."
2024-03-18 11:26:05,"I've enjoyed trading on Coinbase since 2018. Back then I didn't mind how primitive the mobile options were, however the current version of the app is a step down from versions I've seen last year. My portfolio is not showing me a line graph for my daily P/L or my lifetime P/L like it used to. I also find the app a lot less intuitive, than it has been in previous versions, and I don't feel confident making any trades other than market buys from my app."
2024-01-27 12:39:06,"The app has had ""bug"" for the past several MONTHS. I open the app up and I can't see my balance whatsoever, It's just several black dots. When I reached out about this issue the support team told me that I should try using a computer. When I asked if they were aware of the issue and if they had any plans on correcting it they ignored me and closed the chat. Well, it's been months now, still can't see my balance when using my phone."
2024-04-02 12:50:45,"For the past 2 months this app is basically unusable for spot trading. Clicking buy or sell results in lag and a wait of 1-2 minutes before a window pops up, then it takes another minute for any box selected to prompt the keyboard, then another laggy slow struggle to input numbers, then if all that works the system often crashes completely. This is basically unusable and my funds are going to other apps now sadly. No one can trade with these circumstances, it is broken."
2024-03-14 17:36:42,"This latest update is horrible. I too am having issues with glitches trying to get basic info such as price graphs, much less trying to complete trades in the moment. The worse part of the upgrade that needs to come back is the feature that allowed you to see the execution price of the trade without having to find the order and open it. Please bring back the execution price in the summaries."
2024-03-21 23:28:55,Opened account before the whole verification process was mandatory. Don't like that I need to send in a photo of my driver's license and then record a video of myself just to be able to log in to get my W2s. I should have been given the option to transfer money out and get mailed my tax documents and close my account without sending this to them. I understand verification security but I would have never signed up if this was required to begin with.
2024-03-26 14:27:35,"Can't imagine trading with this app. I use advanced trader mode to monitor only. Latest update removed mini charts from watchlist (Was same as desktop browser). Watchlist/pair list can't be sorted by gain, price, or name anymore. Order book and depth charts still aren't adjustable. 8 seconds lag when loading charts on 5g wifi. It doesn't swipe to next in list like Webull. You have to exit and wait for it to load again. Simple mode has better stats on holdings, so you have to switch modes."
2024-03-15 20:23:02,"It lacks the clarity, especially when buying. E.g. why is price to buy a crypto higher than the one shown on home screen - it's not clear where the difference is coming from. Notifications are a mess. In Android app settings I cannot set only certain notifications I would like to receive, the names of notifications are identical and they say nothing. In app itself I cannot set notifications for specific values of certain currencies."
2024-02-29 11:41:08,"They ask for a clear photo for the identity verification, but it's the app that destroys the photo's quality. The phone is good, the camera works perfectly, but after the photo is taken, THE APP destroys its quality. So, I cannot get verified, and it's their fault. How is an app useful if the main verification needed for most interesting functionalities is literally not possible..."
2024-03-29 14:08:34,"Great place to find all sorts of crypto, but if you don't mind fees, then this is the platform for you. Shouldn't cost anything to convert coins from one to another, along with fees to buy and sell. Seems excessive to me, I haven't sent coins yet, and I'm sure it also costs money. Not looking to stay on here, there are better brokerages."
2024-03-19 10:48:16,"It's not working well. I've tried reaching out customer service, but no luck, no one has ever answered the texts, they just close the case. The app doesn't allow me some basic features such as setting up account all the way or such as adding a payment method for no reason what so ever. The worst part is that you can't get any help no matter how hard you try."
2024-03-20 21:29:23,"The app is a bit clunkier than the pc browser experience, but it does have more ""learn and earn"" options (I guess the browser version hasn't been updated in some time). Coinbase is beginner friendly, but the trading fees are kind of high. It's not bad but it's not the best. I'd still recommend for beginners."
2024-03-24 06:22:54,"User friendly to buy and sell crypto. But using this app for about 3 years, the downsides start growing as you start growing. The use of advanced charts help but their system for your porfoilio is lacking. (The display for gain, loss, avg cost, weird graph display, the list can go on) Some features seem to get laggy over extended periods of time or high volume on high traffic days. The app i believe is great for people who want to get their feet wet in crypto. Just lacks efficient display."
2024-01-25 23:50:17,"This is getting ridiculous.. Not only does the app force close after every transaction on the OTC side, but now on the advanced side it won't even show me candlestick charts. I had made it all the way to the third tier of trading volume but clearly there needs to be some reinvestment of all those fees into your struggling infrastructure. I NEVER had issues like this on Binance. And yes - I've done all of your troubleshooting steps- but reinstalling a broken app isn't going to fix it, obviously."
2024-04-12 04:04:35,Changed my phone number and absolutely impossible to access my account. Verified my identity twice and it still won't let me login without some long passcode that I do not have. Unable to reach any sort of live support it's all bots and text articles that are not helpful. Plenty of other digital currency wallets that work better and have decent customer service. Just wish I could close my account but cannot reach anyone. Don't bother replying. Uninstalling now.
2024-01-28 14:57:30,"Can't pass identity check, before I upload anything, when I have to select driver license, it goes to the camera and it says ""something went wrong"" with a toast dialog. The app has the permission to use camera and photos. Ok that's fixed. Now I get a pop up that tells me to confim my information, I enter the app and it's a blank screen with a round arrow in the center."
2024-01-27 16:59:47,"This app has been great for me for the most part, until the latest update on 1/19/2024. Since then, no charts will display in advanced mode. I've reinstalled the app multiple times, updated my phone, dumped caches and app data...all kinds of troubleshooting, and finally contacted support only to be told ""the app isn't optimized for your phone yet"" (a galaxy S22 ultra on which I've been using coinbase without issue for at least a year). Please fix this! The app is useless w/o charts!"
2024-03-05 22:49:35,"Yes, the app allows you to buy crypto, yes it has good features and I like Advanced Trading. But, wow, does this app have incredibly bad performance issues. It is incredibly laggy and buggy. It's very frustrating when I go to place a buy order, and after all the lags, the price moves up 3%. Please please fix this"
2024-03-08 02:11:20,"With all the heavy traffic in the markets the mobile app functionality is so degraded that it makes it barely useful. I have no access (except on my laptop) to the numbers of coins I have, or their value, or the change in the values in my account. All I get is the price per any coin or token. Used to be a good app - 5 stars."
2024-03-02 20:10:29,"While I do really like coinbase as a whole, because of the convenient all-in-one setup they have. The limiting of the amount of crypto you can buy each week is just stupid. Many times I've had money but couldn't make a purchase due to the limits. If that was changed then I'd give it a higher rating. I know it's probably to help avoid fraud or something but it's just super inconvenient sometimes and irritating. Other than that it's a pretty good wallet."
2024-02-22 11:33:09,"Terrible app, terrible support. Send two transaction and got an error, then for some reasons they were confirmed, asked to cancel it because of i got the error and didn't think that it'll be finished, support told me just no, we cannot do it. I was charged on 80$ just because of technical error. Great!"
2024-03-05 13:45:08,"New update of the app is horrible!! 50٪ of the time there are glitches, it won't log on, something won't open when finally in the app, inaccurate amount showing when trying to cash out, etc. Why change something when there wasn't anything wrong with the old app. STOP FORCING UPDATES THAT AREN'T NEEDED. Can't wait to get my money out, done with this nonsense. I have reached out to support several times & get the same answer. ""Let me look into, have you tried deleting the app & reinstalling?"" Yes"
2024-03-05 21:28:00,"All the sudden I cant trade due to connection issues, tried 5G, tried wifi, tried on another device and carrier. Support is just a robot that goes in circles. Very sus of you coinbase. Edit to reply: No thanks your in app support chain should have worked. You came back up long enough for me to cashout after losing 10 more points and all trust for your platform. Going with a platform that didnt just mysteriously crash during a large sell off."
2024-03-22 20:56:57,"Biggest POS use a different app. I created an account, jumped through all the hoops to add my bank, then purchased $50 worth of bitcoin. 1 day later it told me my bank reversed it and I have 5 days to pay. So I added a paypal account in doing so said i couldn't pay this with credit card and asked to add debit which I did after setup I tried to pay with it but it doesnt show up as a payment method. So I added the debit card directly again doesnt show. Help desk is hour+ wait. Not worth it!"
2024-03-07 13:09:17,"Frequent crashes and sloppy user interface that doesn't make much sense, and they keep changing it for the worse. Edited to add: this is the very first time I've ever heard back from Coinbase and I've sent them numerous emails for support and never heard back. They don't care to support you if you have issues accessing thousands of your own money, but care when they look bad publicly."
2024-03-20 12:19:55,"Annoyed me for the LAST time!! ...They ask me for verification EVERY single login just because their customer support is too lazy to check the FIRST TIME I sent verification- they say ""you haven't verified your identity yet"" and I can't even use this app to buy and trade with new funds... I haven't been able to in a long while. I've been putting up with this for over a year, and I don't know why... GOOD RIDDANCE"
2024-02-23 08:54:19,"Honestly, it's a great exchange. Mind it, I've had problems, like alot or people. For me the length of time it takes customer service to resolve the issue, takes alot longer than some other exchanges. That being said, I've never had an issue go unresolved with Coinbase. That speaks volumes. So, needless to say, it's a good,fast (deposits/withdrawals, buy/sell) user friendly exchange,"
2024-03-08 21:09:04,"Submitted id, pp and drivers license. Still got emailed saying unable to verify account. Why do u need a drivers license for a crypto trading account? Update again- went to the link provided below. Typed in everything including the verification code from the email. Clicked submit and still nothing happened! Whole thing a very draggy painful process. Very poor. Update again - Entered the verification code and clicked submit.. Nothing happened. Tried it 3 times. Pls get someone to contact me"
2024-02-02 15:26:55,"Some coin charts are not showing up, coins transaction history is not showing anymore. When I open the app is just a black screen. Assets page comes up with and error and doesn't display my assets. Everything got worse in the past 2 years with this app. And I lost 90% of my investments. Don't bother making an account on coinbase. Maaaannn.... even now I ma not able to sign in, I tried on different phones, whe I press sign in button it gives me error."
2024-03-07 06:51:10,"App suddenly tells me that my device is not supported even though I have the required Android version and there has been no update. Thanfully I can get it working on Bluestacks emulator, but this extremely frustrating and concerning, especially since you can only confirm Coinbase Card transactions via the app, it's not possible via the website as far as I know."
2024-03-28 18:59:59,"The only customer service they have is a chat bot that doesn't understand basic questions. The app hits you with hidden fees for everything. They keep responding with this help page on negative comments, but it's a joke. I've been trying the phone number for 3 days and tried all the options. It keeps saying chat over and over, higher than normal call volume, then just hangs up. It is the most frustrating call line ever, so I def would not trust this app with a large amount of $!"
2024-02-15 23:15:58,"Since a few days ago the app won't even load. first it signed me out I had to jump through hoops to log back in, after a day it stopped working completely. Won't even make it to the log in prompt. I've cleared my cache and storage and re installed still nothing. It's scary to have your money tied to an unreliable app like this"
2024-03-29 15:29:48,"Installed app, launched it, pressed Sign In. Error: Something went wrong. There was a problem while launching Sign In. Please try again. Result: cannot sign in. Waited for a few days, now there was an update. Updated app, encountered same error. Unacceptable... Update: Developer reply just shows how much they care... The app has 1.5 ⭐ on the store, everybody complains but they act like there must be an issue on my side and I should waste time to raise a ticket. Btw, error still occurs."
2024-03-04 18:24:31,"Full market on and platform freezes a lot, you can not operate: get into a good buy or exit when prices are dropping. To make you feel better your balance suddenly goes to zero. Also can't customize price alerts to what you need. In the US you are stuck with this. Unbelievable. One star because I can't give up on them. I need this to work."
2024-03-01 02:30:08,"I am so sick and tired of this app. Every, single, time you need to log in, you can expect hundreds of attempts, each time making it to the ""2-step verification"", begging for a Google passkey, completing it, and going right back to the log in screen. This is a completely broken app with my money still left inside. Useless trash I wish I never downloaded."
2024-04-08 08:56:38,"!!!!!!!SNEAKY APP BE WARNED!!!!!!! When buying coins the app defaults to USDC instead of the USD you have in the app, and if you have a bank account linked to the app it automatically deposits the funds from your bank to buy USDC then make whatever transaction you were originally trying to make. Imagine my FRUSTRATION when I was trying to quickly make a limit order only to find 2500$ in pointless USDC in my coinbase account. Twice this has happened it's absolutely ridiculous, cashing out buhbye."
2024-02-28 19:38:49,"If you lock your account, your money is gone. Logging back into is impossible, as you need to take a photo of your ID, and the app camera doesn't work. I've tried to use it from the app (permissions enabled, of course), from the mobile website, and from a desktop, and no camera works. Customer service didn't help either. Only use this app if you want to lose access to your money"
2024-03-13 23:54:24,"Transactions have been fast and accurate. However, it takes a while to figure out the app. If you trade fairly often you will be ok after it becomes routine. If you are an infrequent trader, you will tear your hair out relearning each time, where to look for simple stuff. A tutorial would be very helpful."
2024-04-15 14:06:48,"As of a few days ago my phone app no longer shows any of my balances, what is going on?? It shows +******* instead my dollar amounts for all of my balances, recent transactions etc... It works fine on my laptop, and I've used this app for years without problems."
2024-04-13 13:36:54,"Overall CB mobile has been a pleasant experience for me. The app will freeze at times, but hitting the back button or refreshing normally does the trick. Fees are acceptable. Data tends to be accurate also. Keep up the good work guys!"
2024-04-11 02:08:27,it's the only place I can get free crypto just for learning about crypto. it's a win win situation. I just really wish they would unlock the rest of the rewards so I can get more free crypto. I've been on the waiting list for a couple of weeks now. just seems too long. I would give it a 5 if they would let me earn more crypto instead of just being on the waiting list.... Update!! they have added plenty of learn and earn chances so I gave them 5 stars.
2024-04-11 03:36:11,"seems like they outsource alot of if not all customer service. trades feel like some type of a.i. is guiding or what is used somehow. charts could offer more accuracy. I don't like how they can offer a currency and choose to leave you dead stuck and delist it. so, can't say it's a bad app. but they need to get there ""tweaks & updates"" togather and stop changing they're app and web as I feel it confuses many"
2024-04-10 07:34:20,"I absolutely love Coinbase! The perfect introduction to cryptocurrency! Earn real money as learn about crypto! It actually does cash out in minutes! You can view prices of most cryptocurrencies, tokens, and NFTs all in one place and can buy, sell, trade, convert, stake, and more seamlessly. Connect with Coinbase Wallet, DeFi, web3, and explore apps on different block chains. Earn free money and watch it grow passively!"
2024-04-10 05:50:07,"They advertised a £5 credit for first-time sign-ups in the UK, but there's no indication of it being honored or any straightforward means to reach customer service for clarification. Update: Still not able to get an answer about this promotion from Coinbase UK."
2024-04-05 10:50:13,"DO NOT USE COINBASE. There are so many better apps out there, stay away from this one. The fees are nuts! You get charged aggressive fees on top of a purchase and sell spread. Their conversions are insane. For example, you're supposed to be able to convert $1 into one Tether yet, I converted $500 into Tether but by the next morning, I could only get $494 from my Tether. This app sucks, stay away. Kraken Pro is much better."
2024-04-04 08:58:27,"Won't allow me to add my payment method, debit card, my bank allows crypto purchasing, details are correct just keep getting incorrect details, it's not a prepaid or business card either, and the chat help is useless as it's a bot that gives absolutely zero help, why do companies think a bot is better than a human 🙄 just tried to email support, that no longer works 🙄 and the support page has no actual raise a ticket option, absolute shambles of an app zero stars"
2024-04-09 06:08:43,"I would change the rating but I need to have the code I've been trying to send to my account to actually work. I've tried on all the other Coinbase apps and it works perfectly fine. This is the app I need to have work now and I can't get that to happen if I can't even sign in. It keeps telling me invalid credentials when I'm putting in the same exact password as the other Coinbase applications. I really want this to be resolved, if someone could help me I'd change this rating to five stars."
2024-03-28 00:24:16,"App won't let me login. It keeps bugging me to use a pass key even though I already have an authenticator. No matter what I do, it won't let me in. I never had this problem before they started trying to enhance the security features. App was good before that."
2024-04-09 16:25:35,"despite people complaining about the app i ve actually found it one of the best when it comes to buying/selling ur assets. Low fees, fast processing times. Tried 5 apps with 4 - 5 stars only to be surprised by the enourmous fees and a lot of them, cant even breathe without paying a fee in those. 5/5 stars would give more if i could"
2024-04-08 03:06:37,I only downloaded this app so I could play a online game and I wasn't able to add to my game nor cash out. Kept telling me either amount to large or bank unlinked. If it's my money no matter how much it is I should be able to transfer it anywhere I want. And it should be my choice to unlink my bank. Plus all the fees to do anything in it. I think this app is just another way to rob people of their money
2024-04-09 02:38:50,"Pretty great app to use for crypto. Great for beginners such as myself as it teaches you along the way which has been very helpful! Don't like the very few fees for sending and buying but I guess thats to be expected. Good app though, try it out! Also, they give out freebies!"
2024-04-10 23:18:03,"Great platform for trading and learning but some hiccups with user-friendliness and fees are a bit of a headache. But rewards for learning make up for it in my opinion and I learned a lot from the lessons they have. 10/10 but I wish they made it simpler to figure out. Still my favorite platform to this day, I just avoid ETH."
2024-03-16 13:50:11,"The app flat out doesn't work anymore. I have to use the browser version. Literally every time I open the app it pops up with the ""Something Went Wrong"" message. It tells you to complete sign in on a browser but still never let's me on the app one I do. What's the point in having an app if it never works?"
2024-04-15 07:56:49,"I did have it at 5 stars until the last 2 updates. I understand that y'all want to update your app , but s TEST THE NEW VERSION EXTENSIVELY before releasing it. It used to work good, until the last month and a half. I'm in IT and know how programming etc works. Get QUALIFIED DEVELOPERS. When I use an APP extensively every day like I do Coinbase, which handles MY MONEY it has better work flawlessly. It stalls every use , then reboot phone. Tested on 4 devices. I want two free months refunded."
2024-04-02 15:31:33,"Terrible, if I could give it zero stars I would. The customer representatives cannot do anything worthwhile to help. For three months, I have been unable to transact and I keep being told to wait a month. I tried to withdraw and the app prevents me. Upon contacting customer support again, I was told to wait a month or sell my assets. I definitely won't be recommending from now on. I have already reached out to support 4 times and got the same response, wait a month and try again."
2024-04-09 15:58:52,"When buying or selling, the buy or sell doesn't match the actual asset price. For E.g, the Bitcoin price will be $70k, but when I go to sell, the sell price is $68,500. When I'm buying, it'll be at $71.500. Never the actual price displayed!! Price manipulation is BAD BUSINESS!! I called the # they provided. I did everything they asked to resolve the problem, but they insisted my info is incorrect, lol. NO HELP WAS GIVEN, sadly. Customer service was very rude!!! Very bad experience! What a shame!"
2024-03-25 18:46:13,"The app is easy to use. The 2FA is awful. If they send a code, it's ten minutes after I requested it, which will no longer work. They let me buy Bitcoin, but I can't trade it until after 8 days. Then it depreciates in value, so I have to buy more to cover the purchase I want, then the cycle repeats. Not easy to get support with either."
2024-04-14 20:04:14,As bad as it gets. No way to see your cost average. Extreme fees. No tax statement. Really are you expecting me to download all transactions and do it manually? That's basic functionality that all trading platforms offer. Wish I never got into crypto...
2024-04-08 17:25:40,No theft so far but I have some strong indication that the currency exchange is on a private server and there is some interception math that goes on in a hidden fashion. Steals some profits on exchange rate hikes and decreases. Possible that lots of server switching happens. Cyber criminal havens... Coinbase is no longer honorable entirely.
2024-04-05 11:24:00,"App is fine. Web and app looks fancy. However, the platform itself is terrible. Contacted support and filed a complaint to resolve my issues. Don't invest here. Edit: No, I won't submit another request for customer support. My account is currently closing. You have lost me as a customer."
2024-04-10 19:26:01,App Used to be okay. Now you can't see the screen due to a great big warning notice taking up a third of the screen!! Says it might be a bit risky and you might lose your money. you cannot get rid of it Many users on Reddit say the same. It's been going on for months. When I contacted customer support today they were useless pretending they knew nothing about it and then they cut me off. I contacted them again and it was like speaking to a 2-year-old. I give up I shall be removing my money.
2024-04-12 11:42:18,"It feels like a scam compared to other exchanges. The fees and having to buy ether to do anything with their wallet, just feels like a money pit. I've moved all my coins off and am now trying to close my account. But because there is few cents worth of Ether in my wallet (usually required for a wallet), I can't close!!"
2024-04-06 12:27:27,"Can't login into the Coinbase app anymore. ""Connection trouble"" I re-installed the app and tried a different phone, same problem. I have to use a browser on the laptop now. Update: 2 tears later, I still can't login into the Coinbase app. Fresh install of the app. I can login in the browser with no issues. I see others have the same problem. Worst crypto app."
2024-04-09 14:46:54,"Too many hidden hoops & higher fees. Can't transfer funds until they have held them for a week even though the fees are higher than most. They don't display the wait times until after you committed to the transaction. Won't use them again Update So now my BTC is ""locked up"" and I can't transfer it to an external wallet. I will never use them again once I get my money out"
2024-04-12 01:19:34,"This app is very slow and overrated, also I hope they update their tax forms so you don't have to pay for a subscription for them to make a easier way to file your taxes. Because you shouldn't have to pay for (coinbase one) when we're already getting ripped off on Market prices with a 5% collar at least unless you know how to make buy orders😂"
2024-04-14 03:34:10,"Keep track of your performance page, where it gives the average price, coinbase tries to hide this page from you, and I noticed this. I noticed that my average price changed without me purchasing any crypto when I queried about it from coinbase from where it's outsourced... magically, the average price reverted to its original price, I recorded it and also the conversations. Everyone much keep an eye on this, because if they change your average, and the crypto goes up, someone can easily profit"
2024-04-11 00:38:12,"So far, no major issues and fees are fair. I hope that coinbase is updated to stop signing out every couple of days! It's extremely inconvenient, especially when I'm using the same device and no need for the extra hassle."
2024-04-14 07:21:32,Hands down the best and most informative app for joining an online brokerage firm. Their app takes the new investor into the utmost consideration with all there functions wall to wall being user friendly and easy to grasp even for people completely new to investing. They even provide monetized incentives for you to read there lessons. Most of which are 5 min. or less and end with a short quiz upon which you'll be rewarded.
2024-04-12 02:43:55,"Can't believe how easy it's become since the last bull run. Such a pleasure to use for buying, swapping, transferring, bridging etc. The crypto world is becoming easier and more accessible than ever."
2024-04-13 08:48:06,They locked my account and I have a sizeable sum of money there. The app won't even allow me to take a picture of my ID to verify identity. The button to allow camera access is disabled. It prompts me to allow camera access even though it's already enabled.
2024-04-15 06:50:44,"I use to be quite satisfied with this app up until the past year or so. Fees on cashing out, purchasing, etc are outrageous. Seems I've had to go back and review some account information because support will say that my assests are locked until I make a repayment on a failed transaction. Not as trusting as I once was with Coinbase. Unfortunate"
2024-04-15 09:24:17,"Did a bunch of research, found a couple winning meme coins at low prices.... Just waiting to bounce.... Would NOT let me purchase them with some BS about ""Withdrawal amount too low"" in red! Made NO sense! I tried and tried! Got support on the line, told me to try and buy MORE! So I deposited more.... STILL ""withdrawal amount too low!"" I gave up. The next day, I saw they had purchased AFTER the bounce! So now I'm in at a dead level.... Not making anything! NOT HAPPY!"
2024-04-13 07:34:26,"I love app, easy to use and understand. Only thing I'd change is the ability to make font larger, I'm partially blind, would help a lot. But love the app and coinbase has been my go to for years."
2024-04-14 18:28:50,"Not sure where to start. I just wanted to invest and withdraw, simple yes!? Well my experience with this platform has been to say the least awful. Blocked at every step. THE QORAT PKATFORM EVER!!! If I would have been blocked at withdrawal I would understand but they block you at investing. MY ADVICE : START VERY SMALL if you decide to use so you don't lose money due to market fluctuations but to the platform. You will see what I mean if you decide to go with them."
2024-04-13 12:13:07,"App is so slow!!! The lag just even trying to load simple interfaces is a joke how can you expect people to want to use this platform when performing simple actions is made difficult by lag and slow load times. Sort it out coinbase you are making sickening money from people using your exchange, your charges are higher than everyone else and yet you cant even make your app faster and better to use. Binance does not have these problems and is a far better user experience."
2024-04-05 22:12:10,"Security key login doesn't work. Can't login anymore. Works fine on web, so something is broken with the app. Also they don't like logins from VPNs. Their tech staff must still be working in the 1940s or something."
2024-04-10 14:37:12,great app but need a friendlier interface with better features compared with using binance app but the Australian interface with banking is great. fees are a little high. I would have given more stars if they add better charts functions.
2024-03-21 14:52:31,"I tend to like coinbase, but their consistent horrible customer service and glitchy app has drove me away. Right now I'm facing a never ending stake issue. Unstaking period is a month, but continue to earn rewards while unstaking and those rewards are automatically staked. This means I'm getting $.01 transactions everyday making taxes a nightmare. And it'll never end, there is no way. I've contacted support, but they are easily the worst support in human history. Don't use this service."
2024-03-11 22:19:21,Such a horrible experience. My account has been restricted from selling and doing any other transactions and I have tried multiple times to contact customer service and I keep receiving the wait time is more than an hour. Sure I I wait for over an hour to speak to an agent and ends up automatically closing the chat. I have submitted the necessary documents to verify identity. There's no wait to email customer service. I am very disappointed.
2024-03-05 06:20:00,"DO NOT USE THIS APPLICATION!! I couldn’t even pass the verification process properly due to constant problems in my wallet and the fact that they are simply unable to make the process quick and convenient. even technical support could not do anything after three requests for help were sent. I highly do not recommend wasting your time on this, just read other reviews"
2024-03-21 23:46:56,"Do not use this application at all. It is slow, delayed, so many continuous issues. Will try to make all payments come from your bank account instead of your balance in application. Also tries to charge your bank account multiple times a day to give multiple charges due to their technical failures and will cost you money. Worst crypto application out there. Lost hundreds due to ""technical issues"" with their SYSTEM not processing in DUE TIME."
2024-04-14 12:14:09,Horrible experience. Can't pay with PayPal as I'm given an error every time. Fees are outrageous and you are not given upfront warnings. Then when you are trying to convert currency to send funds you are only warned at the last second there is a $50 minimum to purchase currencies such as USDT. This app is nothing like it used to be.
2024-04-07 18:14:41,App is still almost unusable. Always hangs have to restart it 3x. Takes 20 minutes to deposit money. Don't even bother trying to get in or out of a position quick. Garbage
2024-02-15 03:55:46,"cannot sign-in in app, useless app. Also website is useless, once I saw, what happened to UI, I had to withdraw all my money back to never see that disaster ui again.. and had problem to find even that. Former Pro user, not to mention, this is like third time with Coinbase, when I had to move into its new platform/site, within few years. No thanks, enough is enough."
2024-03-08 01:36:43,"There are a lot of glitches, and it's next to impossible to get ahold of a person. They make it seem easy, and its not. It also seems like im being charged alot more fees then it tells me. When my account jumps $10 from a $2 fee its kinda noticeable. Id love if you guys had a phone number to call for support."
2024-02-29 09:41:37,"Very expensive to use and fees are not transparrent, you only find out the fee when you're about to do a transaction Update: coinbase website is just vague words. You only find out what they will charge you at the time of transaction, rather than a transparent table showing all fees like other providers do so that you can plan your investments."
2024-03-08 18:25:35,"Fun fact! The account setup doesn't work properly, stopping you from getting any promotion deal they told you about! Even more fun is their app support, which is so worthless that you can, and will have to find more help on reddit. The actual trading is fine. But you won't get proper support if something goes wrong and the app can and will malfunction without saying anything. And if it does that while you're trying to invest. Good luck."
2024-03-04 18:32:59,"In fact, the verification process is tedious. How can a government issued ID contain a home address? I don't even know the reason why they are rejecting my ID. The app itself doesn't allow us to take a clear picture. After taking it in the frame provided, the app expands it with a wider background. I think you should allow uploading of the ID instead of taking it directly to the app. Please, it is the same ID I used for my binance KYC verification. You can do better. Thanks"
2024-03-14 14:50:27,"Don't like it, keeps asking to verify I have uploaded almost 8 times my driver's license and it still has issue. Not sure how only coinbase cannot verify but other apps doesn't have any issues in verifying but they will let you buy the crypto such an odd thing. But you cannot send it.You should stop all activities people will stop installing this and avoid wasting their time. Really being a new user trying from yesterday to use an app and still doesn't works. Need to look for some good options."
2024-03-29 02:09:03,Easy to use app. Beginning freebies were nice. I don't like Coinbase because of the amount of fees (and then not being so upfront about it). A big plus is the annual interest for USDC though. Edit: Coinbase Advanced mode is a little less user-friendly interface (more official) but with much less fees. Save your money - TURN ON COINBASE ADVANCED!
2024-03-17 02:07:33,"App is easy to use. Charts suck. Would be nice if the high and low showing in the top left corner actually reflect the day it is. I notice a few inconsistencies with highs, lows, and % showing unless I long hold on the chart to see the day that is trading."
2024-02-20 01:55:05,"It has issues starting up. Whenever I start the app, I have to shut it down and restart it. It won't populate the screens correctly the first time. It also has trouble updating in the advanced trading, prices don't stay up to date at the same time. This is on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4."
2024-04-04 09:46:28,I enjoy using the platform. It's very simple and Coinbase was a wide variety of coins. The only thing I don't like about the platform is sending Cypto. This is the most difficult exchange to send out Cypto. Usually I have to try multiple times to send Cypto somewhere.
2024-04-10 04:00:40,"Bitcoin is stuck in their ""Vault."" When I authorize and move it out of the vault, the transaction gets auto canceled no matter how many times I approve it. Customer service is useless. I tried to get this fixed thru emails and calling, and they never fixed it."
2024-04-07 01:05:38,App has a bug keeps crashing. You can't hook a bank account up or bank card or wire transfer or PayPal account none of it works good luck with this app. Been broken for a month now. . Don't think their going to fix it.
2024-02-28 22:09:11,"This app ALWAYS just happens to be ""down"" when something is happening ( a crypto I own is crashing/skyrocketing) I literally can't use the app in the most important moments! I've definitely lost out on hundreds because of it Edit: unless you plans on making the app work better and giving me a few hundred bucks theres no point in me clicking on your link"
2024-03-24 18:23:28,"I'm loving it , easy to make use . I love sea few exchanges and this is by far the most user friendly especially with the coin base wallet attachment gives me access to more up and coming projects to invest in. I like buying and holding coins so this is the perfect exchange and platform to use it you want to just hold on to coins for the long term to unless ofcourse you want to sell which is also very easy to use with no mistake. I also like that when you buy you can clearly see the buy preview"
2024-01-24 18:10:33,"THANKS FOR STEALING MY MONEY. YOU A%&HOLES. I recently had a disappointing experience using Coinbase that resulted in financial losses. The app's functionality seemed promising at first, but I encountered significant issues. My funds were unexpectedly locked up, and navigating through the resolution process proved to be challenging. One major concern was the excessive fees charged during transactions. These fees substantially ate into my investment returns, leaving me dissatisfied wit"
2024-02-17 13:53:20,"I love Coinbase for investing into crypto fees go down as you use it more which is nice right now, just a few performance related issues as I think th ui uses way more resources than it really should for an app meant for trading in a market where every second counts and also has a ton of trash code that needs to be cleaned up and optimized very badly which is why I gave 3*. Even on a brand new phone everything you try to do lags and it's really bad coding."
2024-03-04 23:22:51,Would be great if the app wouldn't go down just because of higher trading volume. Customer service takes 45 minutes to even respond via chat and there is no phone option. But easy to use and the advanced trading function is a nice feature.
2024-02-20 14:45:19,"Like others mentioned the app has had a ""bug"" preventing you from seeing your balance. Tried contacting their support several times but their BOT generated responses are useless. I normally don't bother rating things but maybe if enough of us give the app this rating they'll take resolving the issue a bit more seriously! Happy to update this once the issue is fixed."
2024-03-11 10:02:05,Awful! Avoid! Trading crypto is risky but this app makes it painful too. Don't bother with the email support below it points you to a generic chat bot hung over faqs. The chatbot isn't great. The tests are more about locking you in than testing or growing knowledge. It's clunky adding payment methods with obscure error messages and screens that show incorrect balances most of the time. Closing accounts must have a zero balance or they take all the remaining funds.
2024-02-28 05:35:38,Love these clever digital genuises! Edit 2-2024 The app is hyper-sensitive with security now. I can barely navigate the app to complete a simple transaction of any kind. They will lock your account up so quick it'll make your head spin for 24 hours. It gives me a bonkers amount of anxiety to use it now. This is real money they control that I own. 🤔 That doesn't seem quite right to me anymore... I feel like I just got off a roller coaster All I did was exit the app
2024-03-11 23:05:02,"Have it since 2018, identity verified at the very beginning, picture of ID and selfie. Everything Good. Now I've been spending 3 days going through verification process again without knowing why they are asking it again. Each time verification ends with an email from them saying everything ok, go on line and here again that restrictions and another request to verify my identity. Loophole.Their help team only able to send me link for ID verification, no one taking seriously my claim"
2024-03-02 05:01:51,"This app is so confusing, I can log on through the web but when I try to log on in the app, it takes me to the Internet to login then sends me back to the app login. I've deleted the app and reinstalled and same thing keeps happening. I used to never have this issue, but since it's started I just can't get logged in through the app."
2024-03-30 03:16:53,"Coinbase app excels in providing a seamless and secure cryptocurrency trading experience. With its intuitive interface, robust security measures, extensive cryptocurrency offerings, and seamless integration, it's a top choice. Customer support is helpful, but fees should be considered. Highly recommended for all levels of traders."
2024-03-12 03:36:51,"I've been waiting for my identity verification too long! It's been a week since I haven't been able to access my funds. This is unacceptable, not even paypal does this! Worst to have it, when I've tried to contact support it has been impossible! Every time they show a message of allegedly too much traffic than ""usual"" and eventually they close the chat!! There is no email information where to send a complaint! Worst customer service than even Wells Fargo."
2024-02-26 19:32:11,"They keep forcing new features into it at the cost of reliability and bugs. I've been having more and more issues that have needed reaching out to their support team. It's also really slow compared to other financial apps, particularly with their visualizations."
2024-04-09 15:43:43,"Stupid sign-in button has an error, you can't get into the sign-in page. And this error isn't new either. Several reinstalls, cache-clearings and software updates later, still broken. Fix the damn app."
2024-03-05 13:00:30,"Very simple and easy to use. 2 stars removed for a very scary situation. After a recent update it appears to have turned off biometrics and I had to manually enable it. Now I assume trading would have needed a password and two factor, but the fact that I was able to open my app and. See balances alone is a concern."
2024-04-13 17:23:49,"I leave 3 from 5, if you dont pay closer attention the market will say completely different prices than what your about to buy for, no 2 pages have the same numbers when dual screening coinbase one and advanced spot, if doge is at .169 on spot, advanced will show .17 and when you preview it will show an even higher price of .176, it also doesn't tell you the exact amounts either, the spread absolutely needs to go on the total purchase ... .005 cent can be a lot sometimes"
2024-03-18 21:17:55,"They illegally optained my paypal that's linked to a completely different email address, then charged me $60. When I called to see what happened, they told me that they searched my coinbase email that's how they linked both my emails together. They proceeded to cancel everything and refund me, but instead of sending the money back to the account, they put the money on my coinbase account. Now I have to use the app and already lost $10 trying to transfer the money."
2024-04-01 06:34:40,"Edit -- New Review -- I have tried every exchange and wallet that I could find that are legal in my location. Coinbase is by far the easiest interface, least click happy, and most efficient as far as time or money (from a CB One pov). Easily melds with CB Wallet for sending back and forth as needed. Love the condensed info yet uncluttered look."
2024-03-26 14:31:28,"I used to really love this app before I got married and got my name changed. Now I can't verify my new identity without changing the name on my profile which I'm not allowed without verifying my ID and I don't have an ID with my maiden name on it. Tried contacting them via phone number and they keep transferring me to the app chat which does not help because I'm communicating with a bot, IM SPUN IN CIRCLESS! So now I just have money sitting in there and I want to trade but can't!"
2024-03-18 21:12:20,App is terrible for trading. Orders are very difficult to manage. They don't even show the limit price on the orders page anymore and they dont list filled orders in respect to when they were filled but rather date it was placed so it can get really confusing keeping track of buying and selling.
2024-03-18 15:12:01,"Very user friendly app, super easy to set up and move money around. However, the fees are too much. You need to pay fees for every transaction. Even when withdrawing. If you are Canadian better off using Wealthsimple."
2024-04-01 10:58:17,"The app is unable to login, I have this problem for more then 3 months, with all the updates since! When you click the Sign In button, it says: ""Something went wrong. There was a problem while launching sign in. Please try again."""
2024-03-21 20:14:16,"I can't sign in, I got the error 'there was a problem while launching Sign In', tried all the troubleshooting I find, reinstall app, clear cache and storage data, connected via mobile network, app is updated to latest version, android is up to date, the only way I manage to login was to use a VPN app and change my location to Germany. I can connect without any problem from mobile browser so I assume the error is not related to location."
2024-03-23 14:49:47,"I have been using coinbase since 2012 and haven't had problems near what they have been recently. I have things that are currently still stuck in staking, my daily charts are all just flat lines for some reason, when you try to sell or move funds when it's busy you get errors and I have been charged noticably higher prices than the coins I purchased even got close to in hours. I have completely stopped recommending coinbase to other people and will probably start looking at dex's myself soon."
2024-03-28 14:27:57,My account has been working well recently. Trading and buying is easy. I had a problem accessing my account in the past when a factory reset was performed on my phone and I could not reach customer support. So I always fear changing phones or going to factory settings.
2024-03-29 22:37:27,"Great centralized exchange. Pleasant user interface, learn and earn programs. Ultimately though, if you want to own your own cryptocurrency you need to get a physical wallet like ledger. Coinbase and centralized exchanges are great for beginners though"
2024-04-01 11:06:51,"I haven't been able to sign up or either sign in for a whole week now since I downloaded the app, unless I use VPN, and even after that's, when I am almost done signing up, it will tell me to switch off my VPN or connect to Wi-Fi, I simply don't know the issue with coinbase app.... Please the link you sent me in invalid"
2024-03-25 21:21:58,"Very poor or non existent support. My account has been locked for months. Support just passes you onto an email address which is never acknowledged and never responded. Expect you crypto to randomly get locked and no way to get it unlocked. Essentially you have no way to sell what you have in your account so when you want to sell, you can't. It used to be good, I wouldn't recommend coinbase anymore. While I expect some level of security around crypto accounts, it's not worth using coinbase."
2024-03-24 15:48:51,"Impossible to contact support. They are total scam. They approved the identity then let me trade then block. They just keep money and not answering. Nobody should use their services. Update: I waited more than 2 hours to talk your ""live"" support and 7 days for email. You are not even funny. Still no answer. The issue is you can't contact their support and their answer is contact support :))"
2024-03-31 18:11:00,Fees are way too steep. Even the monthly plan cost too much. And the spot prices feel off to me. I saw one never using the basic plan and that number changed when I switched over to the Coinbase Pro option while doing that free trial.
2024-04-02 16:38:20,The customer service is atrocious. It is impossible to get someone on the phone to talk to. Their automated robot hangs up on you after you select that you need to speak to someone regardless of the option you select. I just closed my account and highly recommend using a different service.
2024-04-01 10:11:02,"coinbase advanced does not work at all. I have both an iPhone and galaxy s24 I have attempted to trade on the coinbase app and it is one of the worst apps to try to trade on. if you click to buy or sell the screen will just buffer never to load, pick any crypto to try and trade and it will do this. ontop of that the app will crash and be unbearable to use with how slow there servers are."
2024-03-26 07:59:39,"The app doesn't work well, my transfers from Coinbase to Coinbase wallet don't go through half the time, which is why I have a long delay when purchasing cryptocurrency. Also, my crypt disappeared when I was making a bridge, and no one has helped me with this, support has not responded. One plus of this application is the ability to buy some cryptocurrencies that are not available in other places. However, the service itself works poor and is one of the most inconvenient crypto exchangers."
2024-03-24 17:05:33,"The worst platform ever! No adequate support, two months (!!!) of attempts to activate an account with endless document submissions, and blurred copy-paste responses from them. I have successfully created accounts with over 10 other crypto exchanges within 1-2 days without encountering any obstacles. Avoid Coinbase at all costs!"
2024-04-02 11:00:08,"After you confirm your address by some miracle you are met with add a payment method. Now you have 3 payments methods debit card, PayPal, via bank transfer. So debit card literally says make sure its debit card mine is matter of fact 2 of them are when I add them error. Down to 2 payments. PayPal will only let you withdraw so why add a payment method ? No sense. Via bank transfer, transfered it literally 2 days ago still not answer. It is just so painful to open coinbase account its not worth."
2024-03-29 12:58:54,"Once you are set up. This has been one of the easiest platforms to purchase my crypto. A few clicks and it is done. And in my experience, I have been able to transfer to a wallet immediately. It has been great for my NFT purchases."
2024-03-26 09:27:10,"Coinbase is extremely easy to use, exceptionally easy to use for beginners and modest trading. The fees are very competitive but they give you the option of only $30 a month to have unlimited trades with no fees which by far is a exceptional deal. They also have a trading platform for experienced and pro traders."
2024-04-04 11:21:48,"Editing my review, as it seems that 1. The international support is available on Twitter (found it myself) 2. There is a community support option, which I couldnt find, only received the link, after leaving a 1 star review here But I really hope that you make these support options more explicit, because as international customer all I have access to, from the help/contact page is a) phone numbers, which aren't receiving my calls, and b) a chatbot, which prohibits me contacting support agents."
2024-04-03 13:54:35,"Does not allow me to put my Australian ID, passport in total fraud company. Gives you chance to invest the outright prevents you updating your information and progressing the account. Sometimes check endlessly searches or does nothing but the ID and information is accurate. Smells like fraud, previous reviews in 2022 had similar issues."
2024-03-19 18:38:52,"I like Coinbase, but it can be slow during peak times. More annoyingly, there have been dropouts and failures, when I've needed to execute well-timed buys or sales. Unforgivable for a platform dealing with capital at this level."
2024-03-26 17:28:56,"Application is buggy. Customer support is just being juggled from one department to another. Edit:From 2 stars to 1. their response is what I'm talking about. The reply telling me to dig through pages of coinbase for dummies came faster than a reply (still waiting) to my help desk ticket to allow me to fix the known bugs I was informed of by cust support via phone call to actually use my account. These bugs require action on their end, and nothing on my end can move me forward at this time."
2024-03-19 18:18:58,Love how your app crashes and signs people out of the app every time theres a major market move. Real convenient for you I guess. Oh and im required to do 2FA even tho no ones trying to steal my money and ive lost my phone multiple times so i just put someone elses number on my account cuz you wont let me disable it. Real convenient and secure.
2024-03-21 00:18:16,Everytime I try to close my account it keeps looping to a previous page. I've never in my life had this much trouble with an app and it's driving me crazy. Can't get ahold of any kind of support and i'm honestly at my limit with this thing
2024-03-24 10:42:39,"Inconsistent to say the least, always has the availability to buy more and deposit. However when it's time to withdraw, the option isn't always available, more often then not, my linked PayPal doesn't appear for me to withdraw too. Very concerning"
2024-04-03 02:10:27,"EXTREMELY difficult to use, verging on impossible. Will not let me use my bank acct., will not let me use PayPal, and keeps asking for my debit card info over and over and over. Been trying for three days and it still won't let make a purchase. No way to talk to anyone. No way to get help. I suspect Coinbase is scam of some sort, just after bank acct info. Perhaps the algorithm only allows the wealthy to use it."
2024-03-30 00:59:53,Overall I think it's an awesome site it has its ups and its Downs it's a little confusing but once you get the hang of it it's easy and also the transaction fees weren't too bad. Definitely would recommend
2024-03-19 13:11:34,What a joke. They somehow put my refunded crypto into web 3 locked out of it to verify. I verified and they kept on keeping me locked out they were hoping to scam me but one the better business bureau gets involved they will have no choice. Even the agents tell you are verified and we don't know why you can't access it. It's a scam and don't use it. Thanks for the support link but I have contacted the support team over a week. It's 48 hours after completion of verification not 1 week illegal!
2024-03-18 15:16:36,"You can't change your phone number if you have a new number to login or send crypto. Fees are extortionate on the app aswell for buying and selling crypto. I'd suggest using other platforms. There staking rewards are worse too. The app needs work. Your support doesn't work and I have to reset my number two times for it still not to update on the app, for a market cap the size of coinbase your app is totally useless. I can gaurantee im not adding anything crypto related to this app again"
2024-03-20 20:42:01,"With the latest update it is now necessary to switch to Coinbase Advance to see the spot prices and my watchlist, but then why can't I see my portfolio and the h/d/w/M/Y trend graph like I can I the non-avance Coinbase? Makes no sense from a user point of view. These changes accomplish nothing except a low rating and an annoyed user. Be better Coinbase!"
2024-03-24 13:30:50,"As long as trading volume is avaerage the app works although i know some people who have been locked out of their accounts for losing or getting a new phone. If volume spikes you're screwed here. Support (outsourced to India) will lie constantly, telling you internal issues are ""global"" issues. Find another platform, it's hard to be worse at this. I currently have LTC on CB that is paid for and cannot be exported, no explanation for why."
2024-03-21 00:02:31,Horrible app and customerservice. Copied and pasted the address and it sent it somewhere else. They admitted they had issues with copy and paste. Unfortunately I can't put screen shots in my review
2024-04-09 06:04:39,"I appreciate Coinbase's user-friendly interface and wide range of supported cryptocurrencies, making it easy for me to navigate and trade various digital assets. Additionally, their strong security measures and reputation for reliability give me peace of mind when using their platform for transactions. Good job Brian Armstrong and your staff!"
2024-03-24 19:33:13,"Suddenly the login has stopped working, after working for years. Can login on the web, but not through the app - even tried uninstall and reinstall to no avail. The app is therefore pretty useless."
2024-04-16 01:14:37,"my transfer from coinbase wallet stuck at 'pending' for more than 24 hours noe, even though it has marked successful in block explorer Update: 36hour in, now it asked for sender detail, but the field for this is missing. Tried the link given, not working"
2024-03-07 01:23:58,"I put 1 star until I know what's going on with my ID verification. I submitted 3 times already. Twice with mobile phone, once with laptop. All rejected with same reason: ""we couldn't verify your ID card + photo"". I ensure texts on my ID card are readable before submitted. Tried live chat, no human, asked me to wait 1hr for human assistance. It's been more than 24hr since I registered, no transaction is allowed until ID has been verified. edit: community-support can't be used. Button unresponsive"
2024-03-29 10:37:34,"I've been using this app for many years now and I never had any trouble cashing out until now, I tried uninstalling it and downloaded it again, but now it won't even let me log in. I go through the verification steps, then it sends me back to the starting page."
2024-03-06 00:27:16,Can't sign in and I find the timing to be quite a coincidence Update - can't stand seeing my hard earned money just melt away so uninstalling. I'll never invest in any of these gimmicks again be careful and be ready to lose it all if you decide to. This app is easy to use and hasn't hampered me from any activity (unlike robinhood which is a big scam or Celsius that just straight up robbed people). Good luck!
2024-01-18 16:23:41,"Can't even verify my identity. The app stops when selecting the option to take photos of id. Constantly asking to sign in, which requires a 2FA text message. Can't contact support through the app because after I verify my account through 2FA, it just drops back to a previous page, and it's just an endless loop. I don't want to call support, I just want the app to work. Uninstalled, reinstalled. Restarted phone. Garbage app."
2024-02-28 05:17:31,"My account has been disabled for over 2 years now because I haven't clicked on the link they sent for verification purposes. Those ""verification"" emails literally looked like spam every time one was sent. Still battling through ""customer service"" to get account unlocked."
2024-03-23 04:03:33,"The app stopped working on my phone since January 2024. It never opens since then. I have updated the up several times, cleared cache of the app and even Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still not opening. What could be the problem? Please help me out"
2024-02-27 03:43:04,"Even though I pay $30 a month to NOT get fee'd to death, it eventually runs out & u start getting taxed like a regular Joe & that ain't right, it's still more compatible than most e-wallets & easier to send and receive so all in all, I like it. Just these fees & Slippage rates take a lot of $$ from ya. Nature of the beast I guess 🤷🏽‍♂️"
2024-02-02 03:55:06,"Says when you purchase crypto you get to spin a wheel to get up to $200 in bitcoin but none of my transactions are finishing the 4th step of ""buy crypto."" Edit: went to the support link and it won't even let me submit the request because the wait times are longer than normal. How tf is a support ticket not eble to go throw its not like its a live chat or phone call. Coinbase has the worst customer support of any app."
2024-03-20 16:32:56,"Avoid this scam app. It will put restrictions and not inform you. Support is non existent (no email, 1hr waits, poor virtual chat bot). My first crypto purchase via card included a 'spread' which actually meant a ridiculous 5% fee. Then I couldnt deposit via bank transfer to use Advanced or even withdraw! Support were unwilling to provide an explanation for the restrictions that were not communicated. But they had no problem pocketing the ridiculous 5%fee. Scam app, poor customer service. Avoid"
2024-02-26 17:54:12,"Just do not put your money on it! They asked me to verify my account again after 3 years of use! I have tried almost 15 times to do the process, my documents are right and nothing is wrong with them but i had never took a response! I can't cash out or send my cryptos and the support system its just a bot tgat says the same exactly thing!I have tried to contact the support with plenty of emails but still! so i have lost all my money!"
2024-01-31 11:12:30,"Seem to be great so far! No major issues, as long as you familiarize yourself with the fine print, holds, fees, ect.. They also offer great rates & rewards! Side note: It may be useful for you to get Coinbase One if you buy, swap, trade or sell it will save you that fee Everytime! That's all for now..."
2024-03-05 16:10:04,"The app freezes all the time. Every day now I have to sign in because my device isn't recognized.and they want to charge $30 a month for pro for what, it to freeze in the middle of a buy or sale no. After ever buy or sale I have to leave the screen I'm on then go back. Do you think that cryptos price is going to wait for me to switch back no crypto waits for no one."
2024-03-18 12:30:22,"Utterly shambolic and frustrating, almost infuriating. Account balances showed zero lately. ID verification fails again and again despite uploading various clear and high definition photos of an ID card, passport and a driving license. No explanation provided. Reaching out to a human is like pulling teeth with three hour long wait times over the telephone. Accepted an offer for a callback that never came."
2024-01-29 21:15:47,"Will give the app 5 stars but all charts snd trading pairs will not populate. For several days now a message pops up saying: "" something went wrong an error has occurred while producing this chart"" Can't read any analysis. Not good. Desktop version works fine. Mobile app does not work. Please provide an update to fix this bug🙏"
2024-02-09 06:09:06,"so far so good...okay... so this is now a few years into using coin base. I enjoy this exchange. It's ease of use is great. Fees are higher for this luxury. They also make tax time great with an easy summary as well as the files needed for break down. Certain coins like kaspa would be nice, that said, good coin listing overall. Invest at your own risk. This is one of the biggest and cross my fingers, safest. Happy hodling!"
2024-03-14 11:24:41,"A piss poor excuse for an app. I got signed out and can't get signed back in. I've requested a password reset, but the links in the instructions don't work! There's no phone number that I can find to contact them. I think it's a scam. They contacted me with a link to get things straightened out, but it took me back to the same pages that didn't work before."
2024-02-29 22:02:09,"The app does not let me Sign In to my account. I get the ""Something went wrong"". ""There was a problem while launching Sign In. Please try again later."" I wiped all cache + data, updated to newest version. Same problem. I bought a new Samsung S23 Ultra and tried from the new phone. Same problem. I can still use the website on my laptop. But the app no work. The support team solution? ""We don't know why it does that, but you can still sign in on your phone using a browser"" Great 👏"
2024-01-31 10:56:33,"I purchased crypto using my bank account. When I tried to do a transfer to another platform, I got an ""account restricted"" notice. When I contacted them they told me I couldn't do transactions for 90 days. Of course they didn't give a reason, just ""for security"". I was told if I wanted my money I had to change it to cash and return it to my bank. They got 2 transaction fees and I got nothing for my money. If I could give them 0 stars I would. My review stands. Support didn't reply to my email."
2024-03-01 13:22:47,The app is slow and unresponsive. It crashes when Bitcoin runs also. So you won't be able to sell when it's time. Had to update review again. The app seriously is the slowest and worst during the most stressful times. I cannot believe a multi-million dollar company can't do better. Their reply is laughable. Trouble shooting? It was my fault your platform went down the other day when Bitcoin was surging? Wow! The nerve!
2024-01-28 15:56:53,"was working fine then all of a sudden Advanced Charts wont show, ""sorry we had trouble creating this chart"" on ALL my devices (samsung phones)..... extremely frustrating! already contacted support who told me they were aware of it and that coinbase status site would reflect this..... and of course coinbase status site has NO mentions of this error thanks coinbase!"
2024-02-17 08:28:28,"I can't seem to be able to sell via the app or the wallet as I don't get the option to sell. I tried to follow the instructions video but it doesn't show me the same thing that my app does. Also on my ""notifications"" screen, I have a picture with a message saying ""something doesn't look right"". please can you help. thank you."
2024-03-05 14:16:13,"Worked fine until it didn't. Coinbase frequently goes down when theres a lot of market activity. Every time bitcoin makes a big move it goes down. This morning the app just stopped working altogether. I'm able to sign in on a web browser but the app simply won't open. If Binance.us was still able to make transaction with banks, I would be back on that exchange in a heartbeat."
2024-02-13 05:40:45,"The app is well designed. Detailed charts are easy to read. Trading is simple. I couldn't reach Customer service through the app, though. Could be problematic when signing up or if a trade fails and your funds are locked in a pending transaction. Coinbase is still the BEST exchange open to the USA in terms of liquidity and active traders."
2024-02-12 23:42:47,"XXX AVOID XXX All of my assets were locked behind some error that only support could solve, but their support is nearly non-existent. The only option for help is to sit and wait for an agent to connect on a ""live-chat"", but you may wait 5, 15, 30, 60 minutes and never connect. There's no indication of how long you have to wait or where you are in line, you just wait indefinitely. Over a week I've only managed to connect 3 times with an agent and they've been entirely unable to solve amything."
2024-03-16 01:19:20,"Horrible company. Absolutely no customer support. If you call the support number it's just a robot saying that they are too busy and to try later. No option for a callback, a long wait on hold, nothing. I have been trying later for almost two weeks now. The issue? I cannot link my bank account. Why? It's a joint bank account with my wife, both of our name are on account. So a problem that is 100% a result of their clunky, awful, and tedious signup process. I'll take my business elsewhere."
2024-03-14 16:36:02,"The worst document verification ever. So in order to use this app you have to upload documents to verify identity and address. I have spent 3 days trying to verify my address and the system fails every time rending the app absolutely useless. Inhave tried photos and pdfs both fail. I have tried property tax docs, insurance docs bank docs mortgage docs, credit union docs revolut statements. All have fail because of your foolish terrible app. I will be going elsewhere now."
2024-03-17 19:47:30,"this account I'm using has been disabled by them probably due to not logging in for areounf a year or 2, tried to reach them and it's really hard since everytime I try I still need to send a verification code AND wait from their end to authenticate the code I sent. I'm giving this another chance since this is the only wallet to support bling games transaction"
2024-03-11 15:57:39,"30 days ago, my account was locked or suspended for no reason. I have less than 10k on the account, and I add a few hundred each month, sometimes more. For the last 30 days, I haven't been allowed to make any purchases or sell anything or convert. I get a message that my account is under review. When I go to customer support, they won't tell me why. I have uploaded my personal information and ID a second time..then support hangs up with no support/ case #. After an hour long wait."
2024-03-10 00:14:27,"This app sucks, wouldn't even open. Keeps on saying there's network issue, even tried using web service and all I could do is reach the help section. Anytime I try to sign in, it brings up the network issue again PS: don't tell me I'm having network issues cause if I did, I wouldn't be able to give this review"
2024-02-16 17:13:33,"I have memory issues and passwords are one of them. When I try to use the one I can remember they wouldn't except it. Now, i don't have the same phone number and the problems just keep escalating to the point that I've given up trying to get my property. It's just jumping from one hoop to the next and got no where. I even sent copies of my id and a selfie and here I am 3 or 4 years later and nothing still. This coin base has a great scam because once you forget your crypto is theirs. Scammers"
