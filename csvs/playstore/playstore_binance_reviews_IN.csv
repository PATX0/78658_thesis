2024-01-07 09:48:27,"The results from the provided suggestion lasts only for sometime, the app starts lagging again, it is not convenient and a viable solution at all. Constant anomalies poses a highly inconvenient user experience, and a risky bug to have during the execution of trades. Other than this, Binance is above all other exchanges. It would be great if the Binance team could take this issue seriously and solve it at the earliest. Hoping for the best! ✌"
2024-01-04 21:46:48,"The interface is not user-friendly for newbies. It doesn't give me ease of access to my P&L charts since the time of investment... Only shows 3 months of data at a time. Atleast like other apps we could see our PNL percentage. The app is wierd with many technical complicated features making it difficult to optimise its use. The app has technical issues, sometimes it keeps showing me white screen saying that there is network issue but there is t any as other apps are working just fine."
2024-01-24 14:14:16,"I've been using your app for about a month now with no issues whatsoever, absolutely loved it compared to your competitors. However, something happened, and it keeps on crashing since 2 days. I try to start it, it appears on the home page for 2 seconds and then switches itself off right away. It gives me the option to send feedback, but whenever I try to do so, it won't take me any further. I restarted my phone, reinstalled the Binance app, tried WiFi and mobile data, and I have enough memory."
2024-02-25 05:19:34,"It kept crashing. It started Immediately after I log in. I've cleared cache, cleared storage, reinstall, but no difference. I couldn't even do anything on the app. After I sign up and the interphase shown, it will just load and then go blank. I won't be able to return to homepage or do anything. So it's not really possible to contact on the app support page"

2024-04-13 05:02:56,"Binance is beginning to fail greatly. Their systerm is no more efficient. The app crashes 30 after I launches it. The awful experience continued for days and I uninstall and installed it back and the worst happened. After adding my email address they would tell me that the email is not valid which is a lie. Even my phone keyboard has my email address that each time I need to put email address on anything, it would appear correctly. But balance why? What is wrong with you guys?"
2024-04-16 11:12:19,"Exceptionally difficult to get money back out into Australian $. Online instructions all appear to be from 2017. I'm not a crypto wiz, maybe for someone who is more experienced it makes more sense but CoinBase was super easy to figure out without instructions, unlike this one."
2024-04-06 09:51:26,"A great app. It's been evolving consistently. However, now takes longer to load and sometimes inconvenient. Edit: The Binance app updated itself (auto update on Playstore is turned off) on 29th March 2024 and the new version doesn't show Futures Trading nor opened positions in futures or in the wallet. Edit: Clearing the cache and changing the language solved the problem."
2024-03-27 20:49:28,"I have been having trouble depositing zar into my account for weeks, I have followed all the steps and I even opened another bank account however it seems like it's a waste of time because even with the p2p option the verification code keeps on changing when you check your email. It's by far the most difficult investment platform I have used."
2024-03-26 11:57:52,"Use Code while signup to get free trading fees. Its great app. But it gets good features and good setup on a mobile device. Trading do get better the more you use. Nothing mind-blowing, but they do smooth out. Mobile Royale is a short match in smaller areas that are good for a couple apps while waiting for a pizza or something. I don't get these one star reviews about crashing and glitches. I don't have a great phone Galaxy S20, but I haven't had any issues. So far it's enjoyable and I like it."
2024-04-10 16:32:31,"Of all the most irritating apps to use, Binance can top the list. The app keeps stopping seconds after you attempt to run it. I was doing a p2p transaction trying to release assets and it stopped in the middle then I was suspended for some days. I have compared it to other heavier apps but those won't stop. I have done all steps clearing cache and uninstalling it but still have same experience. Kindly release a stable version."
2024-04-10 14:15:39,"The app is user friendly though, but just of recent the app keep crashing and become inaccessible. Have unistalled and re-install again but nothing changed. Pls help do something about it. Again the website too is not accessible since the app keep crashing I tried to access it through the website but the website too is not loading."
2024-04-04 14:18:39,"I will give this app a one star rating because every time I open the app, close it and open it again, the app doesn't work it's loading loading and loading, then I have to delete it again and reinstall it. Or later i have to clear it's storage and log into it again and do everything sign up again once done then close again then open again then this problem comes."
2024-03-29 00:05:16,The continuous crashing of the web3 is very annoying please fix it up. Again I noticed a fictitious re-swaping of my coins on the web3 still trying to figure out what actually happened. I no longer trust the Binance Web3 because it seems funds are no longer safe.
2024-03-31 16:55:10,"Used to be great, but now seems to be riddled with issues. They may be the biggest, but are not the best, by far! I'd use Kucoin or just DEFI to save yourself several headaches! Since my previous review they have stopped staking, withdrawals and several other services in the UK. Pretty depressing to be honest, I've made some money, but cannot get it out of Binance, so they are literally holding my money hostage!"
2024-03-31 13:04:52,"Here's a draft for your feedback: --- Subject: Feedback for Binance Dear Binance Team, I hope this message finds you well. I've been using Binance for some time now, and I wanted to share some feedback with you to help improve the platform. 1. User Interface: Overall, I find the user interface to be intuitive and easy to navigate. However, I believe there could be some improvements in terms of streamlining certain processes and making key features more prominent. But he is app very good 💯"
2024-04-06 04:11:10,"The app right now is nothing but trash and needs to be fixed,whenever I try to open it,it says network abnormally and then freezes on its own,I have to close and reopen the app plenty of times before it works, I'm new to this app so it's a really bad experience for me,fix your network issues"
2024-03-25 07:06:27,"Constantly getting ""Sessions has expired"" loops, no matter how often I try to login, which have me force stop the app. Now I am again unable to log in with the app showing me an empty error message that I need to confirm with an ""I understand"", which I clearly don't since the text box of the error is empty. Currently absolutely unusable."
2024-04-11 01:13:43,"I can't reach support team via the app rather can I buy put option or buy sell options without passing a test which shows a blank page despite all necessary problem shooting resolved taken. I wish they allow skip test it would have been better that way. Support is necessary to easily navigate to, I advise. I TRIED ALL WHAT YOU SUGGESTED WITHOUT ANY POSITIVE CHANGE, STILL THE TEST AND THE SUPPORT PAGE IS BLANK"
2024-03-28 01:37:02,"the app keet on crashing, i do try to reinstall and restart my device but still keep crashing and verification failed even i entered correct password, used my finger print, pattern. i try all types of log in, finger print, email, face detecting and pattern but still i cant log in always says expired, how can it be ny log in is expired, please help me on this."
2024-04-09 02:21:30,It keeps disabling my account after trying to withdraw BTC into wallet addresses. Happened twice and it's getting annoying - I've just tried to login and it keeps saying login expired after literally entering in my verification codes. Happened twice and now it says try again later cause I can't request codes to get into my account
2024-03-26 12:16:22,Enter Code while signup to get free trading charges. This binance app interface is actually really good. But some features are pretty low and it is extremely complicated at first takes u a long time to know what are the use of each items and emblems and how to use them. That is not a had thing in my opinion. The community is kinda trash. The matchmaking time is short. The different modes are also fun. Overall a very amazing game. Definitely one of my top fav.
2024-04-03 14:27:45,"Removing 2 starts due to the extremely buggy Web3 wallet. Binance is possibly the best centralized exchange and it's app has plenty of functions and instruments for trading and staking crypto. It's a shame that their Web3 wallet is far from functional - stay away from that, use the main exchange app and you will be fine."
2024-04-14 14:42:09,The binance app and the authenticator app are both not working. Whatever code the authenticator app generates is not being accepted by the binance app and they are using this reason not to give me any rewards at all. Whether the welcome reward or paticipating in other activities for rewards. I'm so sick of it. I even want to delete the account because its completely USELESS.
2024-03-31 00:40:41,"I think it's great, but I only had one problem and that was with a deposit of LTC that was not received or refunded due to minimum deposit amount. I just don't understand where the LTC went if it neither was credited or refunded! Kind of strange is it just floating around in the blockchain? Support just said that they could not give further assistance due to ..."
2024-04-05 06:07:08,"I unistalled last nd again reinstall but its showing blank nd after crashing app has close, as i didn't open beforel nd i have a suggestion for your developer team, plz make sure that this or upcoming update will be work on at least 6.0.1 nd newer also, iam using 6.0.1 version but your app has too many bugs for this version plz solve this issue, i cleared cache memory again nd again but its behave like a unrated apps, i really didn't find this type of app which crashed while using plz solve this"
2024-04-01 08:35:02,Trades I make on the website are not showing on my app in the trade history and trades I make on the app aren't showing on the website trade history. You think it would link properly since its the same account. Website trades are at market value but I've noticed around a 0.7% premium paid when buying crypto on the app and the same when selling (= 1.4% spread). App doesn't have an option for candlestick graphs and isn't easy to navigate. I much prefer the Web platform.
2024-03-25 12:29:38,Real bad app I transfer money from spot wallet to Funding wallet now the balance is showing in funding wallet but can't transferable to another. Really bad don't Install it use another broker instead. I deleted it and even it not remember some one data like especially settings and Giving tutorial to experience traders too .
2024-03-13 16:55:34,"You didn't understand me. I want to choose stop loss price from the chart. But I can't because numpad is visible on top of the chart. When I close numpad, the stop loss field loses focus. I don't want to use the numpad. I want to choose from the CHART. I cleared the cache but no good. I will never update app again once this is corrected"
2024-03-30 18:21:36,"I have been using the app about more then 6 month it was perfectly fine but since the last update , I dont know what's wrong with it's not work correctly show error and says (code 141004 ) and the next page like launchpot and other section which I tying to open it doesn't work properly that way I edit my last post and I give the app 3 stars."
2024-03-27 07:32:56,Overall good wallet but apparently from the desktop app I have 10+ payments method. However from my phone app I have barely 3 which is really bad. Because I don't use these 3 and I'm not using desktop as much as I use the phone and I can't all the time. This means I might miss something big. Why is there no deposit with debit card option in my phone app...
2024-03-24 04:28:42,App is good but I lost it's very difficult to get pass verification I did all crazy things app asked me to do but still verification failed. it should be made easy for people to recover account and remove Google authenticator and change email but no I have been trying to get pass verification for close to a month now yet no avail it's frustrating and dam tired of this nonsense. It should be made easy so you avoid 1 person having multiple accounts with different names in your system. Time wasted
2024-04-02 08:41:41,"easy to use once you know how to use it. It takes some time, but the tutorials that explain how to do what you need to do is clear. the app runs smoothly and efficiently. my only problem is the withdrawal system..it's always down for some reason. but otherwise good and easy to use and play around."
2024-04-12 14:51:39,"Hello,Hope you are well. I like to raise an issue here I have binance installed in my phone for years but now when I try install the updates it fails after completing the loader is reached to the %100 mark and this happened couple times for many days.I don't know why it happens. Can you please me to resolve this issue that would be great. Thanks. Regards Daniyal Anjum"
2024-04-09 00:28:34,I have been using this app for a few days now. It's a nice app and I would have given a better rating if not for the fact that I can't seem to be able to log in to my account since yesterday. It keeps telling me I have no available passkeys to login on my device 😒😑. I have been trying to reach customer support but it always says webpage not available. Please note that this is my only device. There is no old device.
2024-03-19 00:32:28,"I've invested into coins few years back and it's impossible to export my trade history. I can't export history to do my taxes. Also, selecting date range is horrible. Limiting history to 6/12 months is super annoying. I would understand, if I have 1000 transactions, but I only have 10 someting of them. Your server can handle showing all my transactions at once."
2024-03-23 02:01:27,"app shows false chart info indicating a coin has been sold, which might make users buy at terrible times. this happens when switching between apps. restart required. trading fees are misleading because buying fees are not the same as selling fees. i believed i was making profit with my small savings, then realized i didn't even cover the transfer fees from or to my credit card."
2024-02-24 23:04:07,"I have been trying to create my web3 wallet, and the system works terrible. It gets to 11% creating and and error is flagged, always the same. I have tried several times. I unistalled and installthe app again. Iturned off and on the phone and the same issue. I cannot contact anyone to help me create this. What can I do? I find it useless without this feature."
2024-03-20 13:18:45,"It was a good app, for a while. I failed autentification 5 times. With multiple videos. I made a few videos myself, then they wanted With somebody else. I remade those videos with my wife and it's still not enough for them. I feel like they are mocking me right now."
2024-02-27 21:34:29,"I have been using this app for a very long time now and after updating it, the issues of not having access to all the features started. I even tried to clear the cache but yet no positive results. In contacting the customer service, it will end up telling me connection error. Please, I think improvement is needed to be put in place in order to have access to all the features. Thanks."
2024-03-20 06:27:47,It's great exprience generally though the user interface in the new very is lagging. When I try getting back after clicking on something it lags. Fix on that and also make it easy to access the earn holdings easily
2024-04-16 12:52:29,"Best exchange for me I guess, it has all the stuff one would want from an exchange, and most importantly, incredibly low fees, sometimes even no fees at all. highly recommend it 🙂."
2024-01-21 19:57:34,"It's okay, it certainly trades cryptos, and quite a wide variety at that. The transaction costs aren't great. Also, the cost to withdraw if you want to store your tokens more securely is quite high. I wouldn't recommend for smaller investors. Update: they cut pretty much all the NZ services. Still meh"
2024-03-08 11:34:50,"New to crypto and heard that Binance was a good exchange to use. Just downloaded the app so at recent version and the app fails to load properly. Clicking sign up or log in does not display any page but a cross. I have not been able to create an account. Trying to access the app via my very fast stable WiFi (900mbps), some pages load but with issues on them. I will change my review when I can actually get to use the app and exchange properly. Now uninstalled"
2024-01-26 07:46:23,"Something is definitely wrong with this app. For over a month now if I open it nothing comes up , it just keeps loading for long minutes and error message pops up, I've had to go through the stress of using binance web on my chrome browser. I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times and it keeps doing the same thing, maybe I should just pull out my funds and forget about your app coz its frustrating"
2024-03-12 04:20:18,"The facial recognition process is the most tedious, annoying and inefficient process I've ever been subjected to by an app. I've spent several hours trying to get through the app's facial recognition step, all to no avail. I'll rather switch to another app if this nonsense continues, because I've already wasted several hours (previous responses where error encountered without me making any single progress). Just now, I made progress but then it tells me try again."
2024-01-28 13:08:23,"My experience with Binance has been so far terrible. Particularly withdrawal process. Binance is not honest with their customers and cannot say, ""hey we don't like you withdraw your money"", instead they put too many hurdles call it ""client security"". As a customer I never asked for extra layers of security but they keep putting new ways to collect as much information as possible. They find any minor reason to freeze withdrawal for 24 hours or longer. Do not recommend. Avoid if you can."
2024-01-28 08:47:18,"Application crash again and again look like application do not support android 7 and below. Dear Developer please check and resolve and identify the crashing issue. Have already tried to open application after cleaning cache but no use. application behave on closing and crashing. I think it's better to upgrade and update. Nothing change even after updating the application. I do not, what's wrong with this application. even my friend is also facing same issue. May be application developer failed"
2024-01-19 12:18:30,My experience with the Binance platform was amazing in everything related to digital currencies and trading. It is the number one platform in the world so far. I hope to solve its security and financial problems so that it improves for the future. I recommend it.
2024-03-17 13:53:04,"Enter Code while signup for $50. Binance is great but I've spent about a year in trading & used about 10 minutes in match play, not even a full game. Too complicated, too many mini games, required training, and reward claiming. I would love to quickly get into a match but I still need to complete some training and don't know where to go. Even then, it seems like this game is more about menial quests, rewards, and specialized games than normal soccer matches. I'm done with this game. Not for me."
2024-01-30 08:57:24,Everything is fine But you have to focus on drawing Tools. That helps a lot if you add a long short postion (risk reward tool) and some others like when we open a position in futures there should be a option to see over position on large screen and option to trail your stop loss easily... Like in an Indian crypto exchange (Delta exchange)
2024-02-01 14:38:44,"As a digital currency trader, my experience with Binance Trading Software has been fairly standard. Here's my evaluation of it:Firstly, the interface design of Binance Trading Software is clean and straightforward, with a well-organized layout that makes it relatively easy to navigate. However, compared to other trading platforms, the interface feels somewhat ordinary and lacks some personalized design elements.Secondly"
2024-03-15 12:42:55,"For the past 2 weeks, most of the features have not been responding and I got intouch with the customer support through X twitters and I have done all I was told but it has remained the same.I like to point out that it is even worse now..I keep getting feedback the same feedback clear your cache, reinstall ,switch off and that I should check my network which i have done but my other apps are functioning well.Please you need to look into it"
2024-03-03 15:42:57,"The amount that I have transferred is not matched with what I got in my wallet. They took advantage with converting the currencies. They said, the price was fluctuavie meanwhile, I sent them the Google and Coingecko prices were mentioning the huge difference. Ridiculously they were insisting that the purchase was right. It's not recommended to everyone."
2024-02-29 12:40:45,"I cannot scroll my position or orders tab (if more than to orders or positions) all the way down at futures, when chart is open on the bottom. The last one is always behind the chart and no choice other than closing down the chart. This is very annoying, and couldnt be so hard to fix it!"
2024-02-24 19:18:15,"I've been using the Binance app for a while now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my cryptocurrency trading journey. Here's why I love it: User-Friendly Interface: The app's interface is incredibly intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for both beginners and seasoned traders to navigate through different features and functionalities without any hassle. Speedy Transactions: One of the standout features of the Binance app is its lightning-fast transaction speed."
2024-02-16 10:36:33,"I am getting a lot of messages with ""network anomaly,"" which is super annoying, and it's been happening for a while. I wish you would fix this. I have done it all. Thanks. Will let you know and change the review if fixed. BTW, Super is listed as superfarm, and it's been ""superverse"" for a while... confusing 😕"
2024-02-18 11:58:06,"-strict limitations to what you can do from which country, a nightmare for people who travel a lot -everything keeps getting ""streamlined"", and every time the user loses a little bit of control over what they do -asked me to pay taxes in a country I don't even live in -poorly designed site/app trees, some basic features require quite a few clicks to reach"
2024-02-27 21:38:17,"Please try and fix the app, it is misbehaving these days. Can browse through out the net but any time you want to use this app, all you get is network Connection error. And there is nothing wrong with your network. We are losing money due to this, we can't be clear data and cache just to make the app work well."
2024-03-05 07:39:48,"It's the worst written app. Takes more than 5 times to setup security, first the page do not load then to type what you need to the keyboard does not open. Adding a pin says it's done by email confirmation but does not regiter on the app. Took 7 times to get email security setup. 2 hours later I finally got to Withrow my funds with 3 2 factor security. Does not register changes and constantly asking for more information, typical scam signs. Also unable to unlink banking details. Dont trust it.."
2024-03-05 05:31:22,"This app has been frustrating me, since ever I'm using it, when I try to open the app, it doesn't open, rather it keep loading loading and goes completely blank, keep wasting my time, the only way I can use this app is to uninstall it and install it again, then it'll open, if I use it for that time, later on, if I come back to the app, it will not open just blank, untill i have to reinstall it again, continuosly, this process is frustrating, and giving me a bad experience with this app"
2024-03-13 00:31:04,"It was working well for me but recently when payment options were removed, u only allow a Visa card and I don't have one.secondly bank transfer photo I'd isn't recognising a valid driving licence and saying it's not a valid I'd document for the country?! I mean what the..iv been missing so much n can't use it anymore for transferring money in n out.please resolve this!"
2024-03-05 12:13:10,"1. **User-Friendly Interface**: Binance app offers a seamless user experience with its intuitive interface. Navigating through various features such as trading, deposits, and withdrawals is effortless, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced traders."
2024-02-26 11:49:11,"Please what is happening, I was unable to withdraw, then I decided to uninstall and reinstall the app, now I cannot access my account. I was able to later withdraw smoothly from the website without issues using opera mini browser after several failed attempts with chrome. But the app is still not working, please kindly fix it."
2024-03-17 01:01:19,After new update My Binance App is crashing continuesly and I'm unable to login back to my Binance account. It closes automatically. I have tried dozens of times but still it's closing by itself. Kindly resolve the issue as soon as possible as I'm currently in a trade. It could be a huge loss for me.
2024-02-24 17:22:11,"I have changed my mobile, unfortunately my Binance is not opening. There is a lot of fund in it. If it asks for a pass, give it, but it is not giving the option. Just write that it is..YOU don't have an available passkey to complete verification on current device.While I had put the finger and Gmail is also there, the password is also there is also the finger. Now what is the solution to open it and start working?"
2024-03-04 23:18:54,"The app only offers 1 payment method ""bank transfer"" and unfortunately neither visa nor mastercard accounts work (both cards cannot be used. I attempted to add google pay, that also does not work, as stated there is only 1 option that comes up when trying to buy, and that's bank transfer. This is seriously frustrating, I'm seen coins I'm trying to buy increase and I'm unable to pruchase any."
2024-03-11 12:01:27,Please and please binance fix this problem you have with your app. I've never had any problems with your app before but now I can't even login back to binance it just keeps going back to the homepage if I try. I've done everything possible to see if this problem is from my end;I'm sorry but I'm leaving a one star until you fix this problem
2024-03-17 21:00:12,"The worst trading platform ever. There is no security. Anyone can access your account and use your funds as they want and if you'll contact costumer services, first they will ask you to verify your account by email and authenticatior app code and in the end they'll say that we cannot do anything to retrieve your account sorry. And even you asked them to deactivate your account they won't do it either. Worst security ever. I'm writing this review from my personal experience. I won't recommend it."
2024-02-02 01:11:17,This app is the worst thing ever. I have been having a problem with my login where by it tells me that my account is blocked. I have tried everything even contacting support but no help has been provided for the last one month and I have lost very important transactions. If you can stay very far from this app.
2024-02-18 12:53:50,"There are much better apps for much smaller exchanges. Why can't we see the average cost, daily or 7 weekly % returns, total return of a position and the usdt value of an item in the wallet views? Now we can only see how many of that coin we have. Plus, in the overview chart, why do you group smaller items as 'Others', someone may have 100 coins for example. Purchasing and other modules are better, main problem with Wallet view. 2024 update: their app has improved considerably, so.my new 4s."
2024-03-16 15:50:37,I have an issue in my account i left the app since 1 year but not delete the account all things perfect and also my account is verify but after that suddenly I look my account than this shows an option that due to some security reason you can't continue your application in your country and withdraw all your money and also my account verification failed please solve my problem. Thank you
2024-02-19 15:54:46,"Best app to check graphs and put notifications. It is all very user friendly and clear. A pity busd isn't supported anymore for 'free trading' but it is still my favorite crypto app. Haven't tried depositing money back into my bank yet, but transferring money to the wallet is easy. Thankfully it is also still operative in Belgium."
2024-03-12 02:59:52,Was going great until today when nothing is responsive. I use app more than website. Nothing is responding. Got the update a couple days ago Update. Apparently system maintenance would be great to have an email of a date and time giving notice....abit late for developer reply co sidering it was over 2 years ago and binance is no longer usable in canada
2024-03-11 01:44:25,"Horrible app. They make it very difficult to access and use rewards, plus the rewards expire quickly. Deliberate ploy to promise rewards and not pay them out. Edit - other exchanges will just deposit rewards straight into your wallet with no issues. I'll stick to them in future"
2024-03-10 13:41:51,"😅 Well if you respond after 3 years... I believe so >> 2021 You could improve transactions calculations views by adding more descriptive infos in the full app. There is too much stuff that could be added manually by using the settings , also the view can be checked from a drawer instead of so many tabs. Hire a better ux guy."
2024-03-05 19:45:06,"The app constantly uses a large amount of traffic, wifi or mobile, idle or active. This is probably the reason for the high battery consumption of this app. Clearing the cache, data, and reinstalling doesn't help. Support is unreachable. Only a forced stop after each use partially helps, although this is not very convenient."
2024-02-10 09:24:43,This app is getting annoying by the day. I have been using this app for a while and I've never had this kind of experience I'm. before now it's working experience was very fast and reliable but now it's working experiences annoying how can I have an app on my phone and yet it keeps freezing it will not open. whenever I am to use this app I will have to go to app settings to clear cache before using it. now I have a pending transaction and I can't even run it successfully without clearing it
2024-03-10 00:02:29,"I'd be rating binance a star cos that's what they deserve right now, I haven't been able to read notifications, posted articles and a lot more, it keeps telling me ""connection error"". When there's absolutely nothing wrong with my network. Currently using the same network binance tagged error to drop this review. Ekú isé oo"
2024-03-14 17:33:33,"Not user friendly at all. Also even though I initially managed to deposit euros via debit card, it has allowed me to deposit further. Error appears, and funds aren't transferred to Binance account! Very frustrating!! And the chat assistant isn't useful either!"
2024-02-14 20:30:44,"The 2FA is not working. I am having issues signing in my account. Even wen I click on ""This device"" on connect key, it would keep loading and won't pass that stage. If I need to use Authentication app, once I leave the Binance app to get the code, it sign me out and I have to begin the process again while the code expired. I am tired."
2024-02-29 11:08:17,"Hi developer, try to correct the select trading zone on p2p. The bottom tab does not display well on most device. The options are hidden. I have reinstall, delete, and clear cache. Still can't see p2p list on my NGN P2p. The app was perfect before your last update. But after, the NGN P2p is list is hidden."
2024-02-07 14:31:02,"My account got blocked without any reason, and I couldn’t get back my money. Trying to sort it out got me nowhere, and thinking about taking them to court? Seemed like a huge challenge. Turns out, I’m not the only one with this issue. I found a lot of similar stories out there, be careful before trusting your money here or you may lose it as it happened to me. Edit: Don't call me Binancian anymore, no point on sharing the id, support was already final with his words. Talking with police soon."
2024-03-09 16:04:18,"Legit makes things way more complicated than it should be. Absolutely garbage app. I think you should add a withdraw button on the, near the deposit button on the main page. So I don't have to navigate to wallet-overview. Thanks"
2024-03-05 16:16:38,"Hi Binance, please fix your favourite dashboard, there is an issue still going up and down when scrolling. I already edit and arrange the coin but after scroll down, the apps going up again and again and difficult to scroll and check one by one on favourite. Please make it static after edit and arrange on Favourite Market Menu on your apps."
2024-02-01 18:54:48,"Best trading experiences so far and zero lost assets. Still one disturbing concern, which made one star disappear - their VISA card program for the European customers died just like that in December, although the card was released fot 3 years and should not have expired before 2025. You just don't expect this kind of mess-ups from so huge financial institutions, which are worth of billions of dollars!"
2024-01-23 05:24:03,"I've been using binance for more than 2 yrs and I've never experienced any issues with them. However, with this new update I can't access the app, the pages just keep loading without ever opening. What is the solution, binance?"
2024-03-07 09:11:40,So far I love this app.. Everything is so easy to understand. YOur simple earn products and futures are my favorite. I also love the campaigns and rewards its downside is for telegram campiagns rewards take too long to be distributed. Also can a p2p merchant be disabled after being reported cause some are becoming too much with the scams. Other than that the app works amazingly would totally recommend it
2024-02-18 19:25:04,"I have been using this app since 3 years and it is number one in the whole world..However the last update I did some days back makes the app to be slow.My phone is 8gig +6 RAM and every other heavy apps are working fine but binance once I log in, the speed of the app is very slow with this latest update."
2024-04-08 11:30:34,"Your app seems to have become ineffective as whenever I attempt to buy currency, neither photos upload from the gallery nor do messages get sent promptly. This is frustrating; please fix these issues."
2024-04-02 04:50:02,"The best and most trustworthy exchange in the world, others should learn from binance, about customer protection and prioritizing customer satisfaction over platforms interest. seriously, none come close to binance. They deserve more than five stars, getting your funds out is as easy as you got it in, not like other platforms that delists a coin without prior notice. Binance is king of all."
2024-04-02 00:56:29,I can't enter my account it doesn't allow me to it keeps stopping and restart and i did all the things that was suggested in the comments (clear casha change network and restart phone )it still doesnt work now after i enter my gmail and click on next so i can write my pass it gives me a exclamation mark and i (understand word ) that the app wants me to click on this is extremely frustrating please fix the problem
2024-04-11 06:23:35,"I downloaded and installed the app. It's saying it's not available in my country. Lol, Florida USA? No, a VPN is not being used. Problems with install and using, problems with my money? ***I opened the account on their website, same error."
2024-03-28 08:23:02,"The app was working positively. But from past three days it suddenly stopped /hanged and shows message""App stopped"" I have updated the app but still the problem is same. Very disturbing.will give 0 star if available"
2024-03-24 15:17:12,"I do not recommend, when depositing money it takes 2 seconds, if you want to withdraw it is a big challenge, 1000 steps to go through. I recommend other platforms, including Revolut, the only advantage of Binance is that there are many cryptos, but it wouldn't really be an advantage, since you can find the most important ones anywhere."
2024-03-25 22:06:52,I am trying to change my email address as i don't have access to my email and signout in binance account but i have access to my phone number only so the issue is i have submitted request through process it has asked me several times from last 2 months but my account email is not updated yet and i don't have access to my old email address which i used to use for binance account. Kindly solve my issue
2024-04-03 04:55:33,"It was very difficult to start because my mobile camera was not right and the documents were not completed and I thank my friend who kept giving me details about it. Yes, if I like it, I'll give it five stars because I've only had an account for a few minutes"
2024-04-06 10:30:03,"I used to love the app but nowadays I keep getting the network anormaly prompt and I can't even login to know how my coins on spot are doing.... it's been frustrating for months, cleared cache yet nothing has changed."
2024-03-27 13:05:16,"Please I don't understand this, account I have been using since last year just last two weeks I tried logging in the normal way I usually do and It say Binance account not found so I thought maybe I missed to update so I did, still the same, I have to uninstall and reinstall, I logged in with the same account it brought me to a new account that has nothing inside and unverified account, whereas my account has been verified and I have been trading with it, so please help I need my account back."
2024-04-08 10:02:21,"After updating, I faced crashing issues frequently. My Phone Samsung Galaxy A72 with Android 14. I am unable to use the App . Kindly resolve this issue as soon as possible."
2024-03-17 15:36:42,"Omg don't use this app! They literally stole money from me on my first wallet transfer! They also have USD transfers disabled so you can't even withdraw money! I tried to send $47 btc to my Coinbase wallet and they stole $20 of it, so only $21 arrived! The chat ""rep"" shay was no help whatsoever. You can see on the transaction hashtag that someone stole the $20! Binance didn't even try to send $47! They are crooks and the only thing I'm grateful for is it was my very first & very last transaction"
2024-03-19 17:08:49,"Good app,, but there's just no technical support to help me. Did not credit my account after making a deposit to my wallet.. so bad. How else can i trust you. Contact support center just tried to blackmail me. I should pay some cash before getting my cash back . 6months ,, no help ... money laundering in the system."
2024-03-28 00:20:59,"What's going on. I can't access my account anymore since I did the passkey thing. It keeps saying, ""I understand."" But It doesn't work. I've cleared cache and uninstall/ installed the app. Still not working."

Please check.""Subject: Continuous Login Issues with Binance App Dear Binance Support, I'm continuously facing login issues with the Binance app despite having a passkey. This is incredibly frustrating and disrupting my trading activities. Please address this urgently. Best regards, Faraz Hussain"
2024-03-27 23:19:15,Waste. Insanely hard and time consuming to withdraw money. the passkey thingy never works. I need to verify using authenticator app and then using email to withdraw my own money. Worst user experience on planet. Switched to another exchange.
2024-03-27 19:03:04,POOR! Often stops working WITH annoying pop up text saying ''Network anomaly please try again'' And why does binance can't catch up the super fast 5G I use I'm sure it's not my internet and its your application which is not perfect! I lost more than 500$ because of this crash
2024-03-08 07:32:25,I was forced into facial recognition as a way of verification and it legit failed ten times and now I have a full day to verify my account. I've been contacted by a developer and told the same thing the app already told me. Deleted and tried again and nothing worked I'm OUTSIDE in broad daylight and not wearing glasses and it still isn't working.
2024-02-14 09:54:42,"My experience using the Binance app on my android phone is Very Very very awful, you need to fix the app , nothing is loading, the app is not associating with my internet connection, it's keep showing me blank for a week now since I downloaded the app on my android phone. But it was working perfectly on iPhone, well I could say it's because I was using the order version on my iPhone and they have been showing me to update the app on my iPhone but I never want to update it. Fix it B, awful 😞"
2024-03-13 11:39:17,"I don't know if this update is not compatible with my device....it doesn't show the icons in the app, keeps showing connection error even after refreshing. Please binance support center, how do I rectify this. I have cleared data storage and cache as well,still the same"
2024-04-16 09:04:24,This is my first crypto exchange app and it was great for some time. Now it is lagging and seems too crammed with features. Other than that it is a great app that I trust.
2024-04-07 02:09:00,"Worst app tbh. When I closed the trade, the margin money didn't come back to my account. It happened twice and I don't know where my $70 went. Trying so hard to make money and idk what to say. And second thing is it is not showing the correct money on my account."
2024-03-27 23:00:55,It has always been a great app untill recently when it refuses to accept a buy limit order to above liquidation point. Many updates keep coming up lately but each time i face a new issue as the last one detailed above.
2024-03-05 08:27:49,"Very detailed app, not missing the desktop version when I use mobile app. The only issue I see, drops too much on network issues. And it doesn't recover even when there is connection. Need to close and restart from the beginning"
2024-03-04 22:41:44,"The latest update today is showing ad before every single page that you go through in the app. If it is only during first launch of the app, it is ok but ad before switching to every page within the app?!! Seriously? Once it is fixed, I will change my rating. Edit: Update seems to have removed the problem with ads... This is good..."
2024-01-23 01:10:22,"This is the ninth day I failed to carry out KYC verification. I have done all the instructions given to me, but still no change. I thought this was the best app about cryptocurrency trading, but it turns out it's not at all. It's not that the application with the largest number of users makes it easy for new users, but instead makes it difficult for users. (Please look at my Binance account so that you can see how many times my account has been rejected)."
2024-04-01 16:35:28,"The app is very heavy; it occupied a very large phone space: almost 2gb for just 1 app; very slow to open; consume a lot of data; n' battery; pls, something should be done about it; thanks."
2024-03-26 13:03:39,"Litterly worst app. I selected auto invest plan with one time frequency and the app bought me slected cryptos with highest prices of the day. I was shocked and when I checked the candle chart data, i found that the rate applied was even higher than the daily high value of one currency BNB. After that the value of my selected cryptos started to decrease which was going high and high just before slection of my plan. I smell that all info on app are scams and A.I based agorithms."
2024-02-15 04:38:03,"I'm Australian citizen and done my KYC so they have all my informations. I wanted to transfer 200$ to my sister using tether because of ease and speed of transfer. they restricted my account (for 1 month) as it mentioned you can't transfer to Iran and it's high risk wallet. It would be good user experience to alert the users, to prevent this uninterntional mistakes. Anyone read T&Cs? This is problem with my account so CS doesn't help you, there is a review team."
2024-04-16 10:45:46,"I have use this app,but it's very fine no any challenges I was faced but the challenges faced to use is for our business, it's very expessive to business need to pay their clients using binance becouse you can't be able to send 3$ and I think binance can add business account feature"
2024-03-27 21:52:28,"It freezes often on my phone, when other large apps like FB seem to work fine! The download doesn't seem to work correctly! Is there another way I can continue to use this fairly good phone?"
2024-03-31 20:55:12,I'm giving this app 2 rates because it doesn't load fast I've freezes and unfreezed it to no avail this apps quality it dropping just look at bybit that came before it the server is fast but binance now the server is slow and if I don't login for over a week if I open the for it to load will be another wahala pro max please try upgrading to a faster server that even if I don't come online for months if I eventually visit the account or app it will load fast.
2024-04-08 09:41:12,"Binance is a good platform. Beware that customer service is extremely incompetent. Also, do not pay for any extra services. I paid for a binance crypto debit card and got zero refund when they discontinued their card services. Borderline scam but that's crypto."
2024-04-10 14:06:09,The app worked fine and I loved it but suddenly i can't log in i tried reinstalling the app restarting my phone and even changing my internet connection but it keeps returning me to the first page i can't even check on my crypto.
2024-03-17 23:24:37,Please move the cancel all orders button from that location. I have tapped it twice by accident. Other than that the app works fine. I can't find it again on the playstore thought.
2024-04-06 17:48:16,"GHS P2P page automatically filter verified merchants. Which put the none merchant at a disadvantage. Becthey want you to verify as merchant with 1000$ as security deposit else 99% of the customers won't see your ad. When you chat their support, they're not willing to help fix it. They just want your money that's all. Which bad for business because of their monopoly power"
2024-04-09 18:03:52,"Great app , education side is very good to do trades with . Also you get vouchers you for just logging in the rewards hub & verifying your account & I love the Word of the day, (WODL) you get points and can share with friends & family & great for memory, too 😀 I find this app brilliant for beginners at trading , it's the best app out there , especially if you're just starting off & learning how to trade . Big game changer for the people who want to get an income, too ."
2024-04-15 04:06:38,"pretty cool app, easy to navigate and the accessibility to purchase via fiat currencies using the most local payment options points out how wonderful this app is. good work to the team and developers!!"
2024-04-08 18:44:53,Don't trust this app with your money there a lot of other platforms that you can trust as binance has the dumbest and the most useless customer service that even existed it's crazy you feel like your talking to a dumb automated robot I've dealt with sandbags that has more Sense and reason that this apps customer service never trusting this app again and I'll be moving every single penny o have from this app as soon as I retrieve the money they scammede on there web3 wallet

Update: problem fixed. But I'm deducting one star because of the situation your Nigerian customers find themselves in. If they can't transact in Naira, at least, those with dollar accounts should still be able to buy crypto with fiat($) ... Other than that Binance is just perfect."
2024-02-29 16:34:10,"Update: The issue has been resolved promptly. All working fine now. Well done Binance team, thank you. giving you 5* now _/_/_/_/_ After installing the latest update today the app was performing sluggish and had time out errors.

I don't know why because I do nothing to cause this to happen. Even I haven't found a solution to this problem. I hope In Future, binance will come up with easy ways to solve such problems. I have sent mail but didn't receive any reply 😕"
2024-03-10 12:58:11,"Overal the app does what it was intended for but for some reason it is supper supper slow. Your apis takes years to respond and I have burned money when closing trades.

2024-01-24 17:39:22,After the last two updates the app is not working smoothly. Prices are shown differently and price pick is also not fast and accurate during the trade. Price in the chart is not matching with the price heading. Please fix this issue as soon as possible.

2024-03-21 08:21:06,After the last update I am unable to login. The app after accepting the password goes in endless loop and keeps on asking for login again and again and then crashes. I uninstalled the app. Carried out antiviral scan. Deleted the cache etc. But after reinstalling and even giving all permission it again crashes after keep on asking for Login and password. I am on Marshmallow 6.1. I have done all you have said Dear and I think Web3 module is not at all compatible with Android 6.1 Marshmallow.
2024-03-24 09:38:54,"Binance blocks accounts without any explanations. This is unacceptable. Rules are for both parties of agreement. If they block user account, they should inform their client for reasons. It's not a joke. It's abt money. And I am pretty sure Binance switched to AI in support department. This is kind of humiliating treatment of clients. Sorry if I'm wrong but I have this feeling after applying for appeal several times."

2024-03-29 13:03:51,It was a five star for a long time. But i've been waiting so long for you guys to bring the deposit and withdrawal in AUD back. This platform is useless if i can't put or take any money. FIX IT

2024-04-15 09:12:57,Binance is very flexible and trustworthy. I gave you five star even though your application can never be perfect. It's just good enough for the now.

Then they made it much harder to withdraw fiat. But I was still generating Eth 2.0 . Which has ended now. I could still use launchpad/launchpool. but now I can't even do that. I almost see no point of using binance anymore. Been a happy user for a few years but after these changes, I'm highly considering using another exchange for my main now."
2024-03-11 13:48:38,"Verification is slow, error prone and frustrating. The average waiting time stated in the app has got to be an outright lie or the process is just broken. How about they call me when agents are available instead of me waiting for 15 minutes only for the call to be dropped half way through. My funds are being held hostage by bad technology. I have no idea where to find a case ID"
2024-03-07 17:01:12,"Binance has become one of the lowest standard CEXes and is absolutely ridiculous how they stopped caring about their clients. Had a ticket open as my transfer was not deposited for over 3 days, they told me that I have to wait to check with their payment provider and guess what? They left the ticket open and now it's saying I need to wait 12 to 24hrs more just to get a response. I'm giving up on Binance after this."

Some traders engage in scams, receiving money without fulfilling transactions, leading to bank account blocks. It's crucial to address this issue promptly."
2024-02-17 17:03:50,Binance is very trusted and it fights against scam as it gives all advices before you do any trade. but I don't like how they ask lots of verification like authentication and passkey. I think email and phone are enough. that's the only reason I don't give 5 stars but I will if they correct that.
2024-02-19 13:34:55,"Just when I thought this app couldn't get any worse! They have these ""earning program packages"" which essentially can be lock in your funds for days, even weeks and there really is absolutely nothing you can do about it in an emergency. Now having managed to withdraw SOME of my funds, I have a 24 hour locked out period for withdrawals and payment functions NEVER USE THIS MAN! Crypto is supposed to allow you the control not the exchange"
2024-02-27 03:46:12,"I can't figure out what is wrong with my binance app since about 1 week, it is always displaying ""connection error, please try again later- error 141002"" and that is all, I have cleared my cache countless times, I have re-installed over and over again, the headphone icon to communicate with the customer care doesn't link up to anywhere, I am really confused about it. I hope my stake in the launchpool and my launchpool reward won't be stolen away by binance because the problem started 5 days ago"
2024-03-08 13:31:46,"From the first time I used Binance 2021 or so I was impressed with the vast array of functionality, features and information presented from its dashboard and related webpages. It's constantly adding new features, and it's clear they have a very customer-focused and top notch software engineering team."
2024-02-13 18:02:28,"Great Exchange and Wallet, but I will suggest to Team to think about addition of the option import Private Key. It was because many users created Web3 wallet in app and they need to export the private keys of wallet and after that there is no option to import the same wallet again. That's why i gave 4 star ⭐"
2024-02-15 21:35:02,"P2P option for seamless transactions. However, my experience has been frustrating as the app fails to successfully execute P2P transactions. 🎄🤦Despite multiple attempts, the issue remains unresolved. The chat feature is a positive aspect, but if the problem persists for more than a one month then his effectiveness will be ineffective. 🤭❓ I advise others to consider alternative apps with better P2P functionality and a smoother user experience. Ad😪"
2024-02-29 07:52:12,I have been trying to appeal a P2P transfer I made for almost a week now. I transferred the money just before the transaction was closed and was unable I have screenshots of evidence but absolutely no where to complain. I was able on that day to upload an appeal but there has been absolutely no response from you.
2024-02-06 02:33:43,"It was a very good app before the last update. I've been using this app since last eight months and generate much revenue from there it was very user friendly but after last update it has so many issues because of those I've to face a huge lose. Neither take profit never stop lose is working, even my trade ends up in a profit nut it shows my wallet remains the same amount every time. Not sure whats the issue bit it's worst app for trading now. YOU JUST LOST EVERYTHING !!"
2024-02-05 21:05:41,"They liquidated me 700+ dollars, because ""9.35 USDT Margin BALance was below 13 USDT maintainable margin required"". No ⚠️ warning. No ... ""Hey if you don't want us to steal your money, better put another 20 bucks on the line. No email, nothing. just puff money gone. 2 stars because at least it's not FTX, they let me withdrawal what little i hade left. The app insisted I give a review with clasic annoying pop up. Here you go."
2024-02-26 08:36:06,"This is my first time using the Binance app and all i can say is that it's frustrating. I've been trying the verification process for about three days now and still NOTHING!!! It's just eating up my data. If i don't get verified, i can't get my withdrawal address. Honestly... I'm just not happy about the whole thing."
2024-03-08 00:23:02,"UPDATE : Finally I retrieved my fund from Binance though it took 2 years. But thanks for the support. OLD : Binance has a instant support team. They just say, ""keep patience"", ""appreciate your patience"", ""Allow some time"" etc etc. Worst support team. They won't help to solve your issue. Instant support message but no action. I've lost big money for this support system and withrow system. Worst withrow system worst support team. Even Chat Bot is very very better than it."
2024-02-09 12:05:45,"If you are a UK resident it means the Binance app offers nothing else other than just its trading platform. Can't participate in launchpad or launchpools, can't stake, can't do anything really. Binance you should sort this out with FCA!! UK residents are missing out on services you offer to the rest of the world.. its a bit unfair really. This used to be a great platform..."
2024-01-20 11:10:24,"I can not believe, after having an account on binance for 4 years, now they don't verify it on the application because of the stupid and inefficient platform, now they ask people for another verification because they don't want people to withdraw and sell to take profits, I will move to another platform so soon and will not recommend it anymore as I did alot before to my friends and community."
2024-03-03 09:29:11,"I am a Binance user for over 7 years now and I'm very very satisfied with Binance. I'm also a user on other crypto exchanges, but on Binance I worked with large amounts of money, and never had a problem (at least until this review:). Honestly from all the exchanges out there, I would stick with Binance, because of the positive XP I had with them. I hope they keep on keeping it good and progressing."
2024-03-13 05:34:52,"It's been weeks since I can't log in to my binance account, the login page keeps glitching thus i cant impute my password. Yesterday I deleted the app and downloaded it again but the issue still persist...this is really frustrating"
2024-02-04 03:03:52,"Please make your user interface for trading perpetual simple, I see why more Nigerians are jumping to buybit, go and see their interface how easy it is to use, transfers, set Tp/Sl and many other stuff, yours feel like confusion in a jungle. Everyone trading perp now, and buybit has made the interface so simple to set and trade, simplify urs before you loose more Nigerians."
2024-02-04 13:36:27,BINANCE is a guru when it comes to service delivery. I have been with them for over 5 years. Their updates has been an improvement. but the little flaw is that Bybit connects to internet faster. BINANCE needs to show a notifier when the internet is fully connected
2024-02-07 14:48:06,"Good app, Does the simple things well kinda heavy on Internet Data footprint which isn't the best if your network isn't strong. All in all, it works quite well most of the time."
2024-02-16 03:03:52,"Enjoy the app. Sometime, it is just too much info. Logging in has become complex since I applied and then removed 2FA 2FA functionality doesn't work with my mobile and desktop. It is either or. At times, I feel like there is too much security features just to log in to my account...password, email verification, phone verification, sms verification, 2FA verification... Too much info...but I am still learning. There needs to be other methods to withdraw personal funds than the P2P system..."
2024-03-03 12:52:18,"Binance facilitates many ways to take money, but they limit the ways of getting them back, they blocked bank transfer and direct payment to credit card! And look at their answer below!!! Other options: sell crypto to others and let them pay you cash!!! But it is extremely easy for me to load money from my bank to the platform!!!"
2024-02-27 07:52:02,"Binance, I don't why it is that whenever I open your apk it doesn't load. My internet is fine because it works well on other apks on my phone, I have cleared cashe and even cleared data but the problem still presist. Your apk doesn't load up, it does sometimes but most of the time it doesn't and that isn't good for my assets."
2024-03-02 09:22:41,"Since 2 months now, I have been having issues with this app. I have lost track of my trades, I have deleted and reinstalled for more than 6 times last month just to check my portfolio. I will appreciate if the issue of blank interface is rectified, we users are losing our funds."
2024-02-27 03:46:03,Features are pretty easy to grasp. There are numerous ways to educate yourself on the market. Identity verifications are a bit tedious at times but haven't affected my experience overall.
2024-02-09 16:41:12,I recently changed phones and the favourites tab keeps resetting - which is frustrating. Happens all the time I tried clearing cache. Installing the app again and the issue persists.
2024-03-02 12:13:47,Worst: first time registering and the experience is very bad. Can't login as it is showing a blank page. Done all the troubleshooting and nothing is working. Can't even reach customer support as its not opening. Please fix
2024-02-06 02:25:02,"good UI/UX experience, reliable app.. been using it for number of years. however, you need to improve/upgrade upon your trade features (bots), ie: martingale bots, AI powered bots (not just random bots labeled as AI, please...😌)."
2024-02-23 19:57:10,"Love binance and it's my best and favorite crypto exchange, everything was cool until the recent update everything became blank. Can't see contents images neither do charts display properly...this has prevented my content creations for the past few days. It very heart breaking to remain in this situation. I buy data in bulks so you don't talk of my network connection...this is glitch and bugs and hope it be fixed ASAP"
2024-03-15 17:03:43,Before recent update app were showing total average profit/loss for each spot crypto. Now it only shows daily profit or you can customise up to 1 year but it's not the same! What's the point to make update that removes functionality?
2024-03-07 09:03:19,"The best crypto wallet ever. But i have only one problem, why cant i claim red packet boxes... I tried claiming using codes shared from friends but its showing ""Your chances to use crypto boxes have been used"". But my friends are still using up to date an are not receiving any message like that... Pls do something about it ASAP..."
2024-01-31 06:59:45,"I uninstalled and installed my app because it was not opening, now it's not linking up my account even after putting the correct Email and phone number. Please what will i do? The App is no long working on my phone, it keeps closing the App as i keep reinstalling. Please help out"
2024-02-01 20:28:28,due to no longer being able to deposit using normal methods binance is a difficult and sometimes expensive way to trade but the app itself isnt bad has become a lot easier to use over the past years. never had a security issue personally so can't comment on that
2024-01-30 06:33:22,"The app is great overall, however, the UI should be improve. Also, a strict policy has to be made to persecute and rescue p2p from scam traders who intentionally delay buyers or sellers to manipulate price fluctuations for their own selfish game. Until I see this changes, I'd return to acknowledge my 5 STAR."
2024-02-21 22:09:05,"I made payment for p2p buying of crypto. After making payment, I went back to click on ""payment made"" but the app just stops working. It kept saying network anormally. I've tried everything possible to get the app back but it's not working. My order has been cancelled but I have made payment. How do I get my money back?"
2024-02-13 03:45:25,"Initial issue has been fixed now. Thank you. Very convenient app, and I really like the Binance services, also P2P is quick and easy. Was just wondering for my country PH, they mentioned banning Binance here, would that also affect us or hinder us from using the app here in my country? It was mentioned that VPNs or opening Binance from another country is discouraged but if it'll be the only means to transfer funds from Binance to a different virtual exchange allowed in my country, is it ok?"
2024-02-17 11:42:10,"I don't like how Binance conceals your entry points of cryptos purchased, after a buying and holding for a while you forget and there is no reference point on their charts. So it's very easy to sell cryptos at a loss if you don't save the data externally, I think it's Binance being deceptive. Could you change that Binance?"
2024-02-19 12:44:03,"Binance is the biggest and best exchange and their app is one of the best, as a newbie or as a pro the interface is welcoming for everyone. And I love the fact you can customise it to your taste."
2024-03-10 06:18:21,It was a good app for business but now is totally failed app for business. Why because when your crypto is in profit they transfer it to earn and at that point no one could sell it and it transfers by itself. I don't know why wether they 'binance teams' do it intentionally or not so please correct the mistake. The Binance app doesn't work properly it fails at different places that cause a lot of disturbance to trade.
2024-02-03 17:40:35,I am very much interested in cryptocurrency especially when I hear people's comments/compliment on how effective binance is. I have downloaded binance but I'm not familiar with it because am new and I couldn't receive any tutorial from any cryptocurrency experts. I really want to learn more from you guys. Thanks in anticipation
2024-02-23 01:14:23,"I'm delighted to rate the Binance application positively. It's user-friendly interface, seamless transactions, and comprehensive features make it my top choice for cryptocurrency trading. Highly recommended!"
2024-02-28 20:36:04,"For long-term hodlers, it's a pain to see purchase history. It doesn't make sense this app only shows limited purchase history. It's a very basic requirement for traders to see and make buy/sell decision. Can't withdraw fiat is in Australia blow."
2024-01-29 18:39:53,"The best exchange. The User interface is great. Customer service is always reachable, which I love, also they always give ""heads-up"" informations. I use to be afraid that my crypto will not be safe but I've been using it for more than 3 yrs & my TRUST has grown. Be rest assured....download it!"
2024-02-15 01:41:45,"Does what u would expect. So expect lag last your stop limit or even crashing the whole process(and if ur into fast money thats how u lose it all.) Binance appn is but they should expect this and make more cloud based, ive made examples. And every time i re-emgeninere it its a huge chunk about 6070going to the android systems. User data, security, bla bla. Data exchange on top of #1. Crypto exchange. Tell ppl to have a phone with minimum 6gb ram or change frsmework."
2024-03-05 18:17:34,I'll rate five stars when I'm very satisfied. Marvelous experience since using this app and platform. Sorry for the late update to my review. Every available feature on this platform which I have tried out haven't disappointed me in anyway. I'll recommend this app and platform to anyone out there who's involved in block chain and crypto. My only wish is that the availability to buy and trade directly with Nigerian bank cards would be returned.
2024-03-02 02:41:24,"I just downloaded this app due to a video I saw on YouTube but after downloading it, I couldn't do anything except that it shows me a blank page that refuses to load. I couldn't even get my crytocurrency journey started due to this, I hope you can fix this"
2024-02-24 01:13:04,"I've been using for about a year now I have no issues with it but today the app is still opening but inside the app they are some place that don't open again, please retify this issue and let's have binace full energy back again. We love you binance."
2024-02-23 03:46:35,"I couldn't access my binance account since yesterday, it's showing network anomaly I logged out and tried logging in I couldn't when I put my email to login the verification image was not loading i even cleared cache and uninstalled, reinstalled it again still the same thing please what's happening"
2024-03-25 18:23:06,"I can no longer access my binance account. After logging in, it kept crashing and return to login page again and again.... This is frustrating.... please fix this issue ASAP"
2024-04-05 21:06:13,"Please i cant access my account for like a week now.once i tried logging-in, the app will close and re-open. I cant do any thing please. It started from i updated, the since then i cant access it anymore.i really need an assistance please..i have deleted and install same issue, and am using a galaxy note 4"
2024-03-30 18:52:14,"Its was workijg fine week ago but now as im trying it, app is not letting me sign in. Everytime i start verification process it closes with the (app not responsing) error. I reinstalled the app multiple times but still facing same situation. Any solution?"
2024-02-09 04:36:52,Squash the bugs For years there's this constant recurring bug where it says network anomaly and you're logged out of your account. Kindly fix it as it keeps us out of our funds and doesn't load the app when this happens
2024-04-12 08:59:30,"After I use it for some times,it began to malfunction,no matter the amount of data I use I cannot see my balance,I updated it and it came back to normal,but now it has start to malfunction again."
2024-04-10 12:17:34,"This app is truly outstanding, it is a fantastic and user-friendly application. It is very easy to navigate and functions just like Instagram. I am extremely pleased with this unique app and highly recommend it."
2024-04-12 18:42:15,"I have been using the binance app for a long time and I've never encountered any problems, keep up thegood work!!"
2024-04-11 05:43:25,Easy to use and the app is not heavy on your ram. Lots of coins to invest in and the notification mechanism is truly great cause when the price of bitcoin either drops or rises you get a notification whether you're holding it or not. love this app.
2024-03-13 14:58:44,Very great app but now very very very very slow.I think it needs internet like NASA's 50g++++ internet 🛜. So please resolve the issue of loading.It takes too much time to open and start trading.Otherwise we are shifting to other platforms.
2024-03-06 21:08:06,Please ad easy payment option I can't add money or buy stock from my card now days everywhere payment system so easy but you make your payment system difficult that's why I have to uninstall This app. Because if I can't buy stock easily then I don't need this app in mobile. Thank you.
2024-02-10 06:34:37,"In p2p Market, it'll be great to have our good and bad feedback about other users on the top where we can find easily since people change their user names and our feedback goes way too below among others' feedbacks. In p2p again, It'll also be great to have an option to see others' p2p trading Volume where users can decide to show and not to as they wish. Since some ppl spam completion rate with tiny amount. And I don't think showing our trading volumes to others isn't such a big deal."
2024-01-21 06:38:49,"The platform's ease of use has significantly enhanced my experience, making it stand out as the best among various cryptocurrency exchanges. However, I encountered a restriction indicating that I am not eligible to participate in certain activities. I would appreciate guidance on how to become eligible for these activities, as I value the services provided by Binance and would like to explore the full range of offerings. Thank you for your attention and assistance."
2024-04-08 07:11:31,"If it had 1-2€ fees by putting money in binance with card like sepa it would be perfect, 2% fees are to much by my opinion. Overall it's very nice and accurate. ☺️"
2024-04-12 20:42:35,"In a sea of trading apps, Binance is a lighthouse guiding us to better productivity, enhanced connectivity, and more fun I ever enjoyed. It's a rare gem that promises and delivers. Give it a try, and watch it exceed your expectations."
2024-03-27 11:19:12,"Used this app for years, every time some update comes out you seem to remember all my credit card details yet I need to verify, I tried 20+ times yet you don't get I'm not from America and don't have ID from there, I'm not happy at all how hard you have made it and want to take MY money out"
2024-03-26 17:45:33,"Great for trading cryptocurrencies. However, I would like to see charts for coins easily from my spot wallet, earn wallet, funding wallets area for coins I am holding instead of going to the market area. This update will make the app a 5star for me."
2024-04-10 09:09:10,"Please each time it requires update, the bytes increases and it slow while using minimize the byte and improve on fast and usability of the app. Thanks"
2024-03-26 11:13:16,Overall good in binance wallet but when I try to connect/open web3 wallet it always crashes. I am unable to open web3 wallet from two months. Please do something for this. I didn't get any solution from 🎧.
2024-04-09 16:18:09,"Great exchange, terrible Web3 Wallet. The web3 Wallet is just the worst of all the options right now. It seems they kick you out of the Binance ecosystem the moment you try to get your private keys. Can't import your wallet back as there are no seed phrases"
2024-03-31 03:18:31,"Right now, the app seems sort of legit, however the verification sucks. Ive been trying for 3 days to verify and have this far been unsuccessful, if i manage to get past verification, i will definitely up the rating"
2024-03-27 00:39:34,"Hello Kumar, Thank you for the contact, we are willing to collaborate in the completion of the Verification process, please attach to the message and submit: Photo of your Smart National ID Card or Passport. Selfie photo holding the chosen Identity Card. - Check the quality of the images: Before submitting them ensure that the images are of high quality, make sure that the information can be read clearly. - Documents: both sides, document edges visible, no electronic documents, not scanned,"
2024-04-04 23:56:24,"I'm no expert but Binance is pretty easy to understand, has lots of features and almost all coins are here. Been using this for years."
2024-03-29 02:15:51,"Out of all the crypto apps, least user friendly. Constant glitchingbin Web3 wallet, won't let you transfer coins to other platforms. 👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿"
2024-04-07 00:12:32,"I cant login, it constantly reloads the login page. Tried clearing cache, reinstalling and restarting phone. Doesn't work."
2024-03-30 17:41:59,"I can't login to the ID after clearing the data of the app. When i log in, it says not available pass key. After many days, I am able to log in again with Gmail ID, but when I try to log in with my phone number, it says Not Available Pass Key. What can I do now?"

Seemless transactions upto date. I wish binance stay up to the mark ofthe best in the world.. Appretiation review.. This is my genuine review through experiencing this app.."
2024-04-04 23:33:39,I feel the app could be made better by adding feature telling the user net invested and profit more financial clarity sell cost.... Apart from that I really like the app

2024-04-09 06:50:16,"I just so much love the interface, the prompts. very suitable for newbies. I like this App more than the website."
2024-02-28 04:14:16,interface design good. but I can't handle easily. And payment option is not available so I can't transfer amount with my account from binance.

2024-02-13 10:08:02,Worst app I have seen ever . They take deposit and when it's time to withdraw they suspend your account. Customer service is not there fro solving problems they are there for creating problem. Once you encounter one problem they will create another problem for you . Even though it is your account but it is under control of customers service.
2024-03-27 21:23:07,"I think this is great. The transactions are amazing. However, value for assets as applies to money. That's the only puzzle."

Login popup never goes back having options to logout instead. LoL Why it says logout without making me to logged in."
2024-04-07 01:46:58,Been using this app for years and was good but lately always crashing for more than a month now or two can't do anything. Getting tired of it
2024-03-11 17:56:18,"The App is nice but I will advise developersof this App to add a security feature to the app where the user will be asked to input access PIN / Password or thumb print to be able to access the app thereby creating a security level so as there won't be any unauthorized use or transactions on one's account. If this feature is implemented, I will come back to give a 5 star"

I have started and not knowing what I was doing but all in all I never claimed any rewards from the app at the start and have tried by all means to learn. I give it 5 star because I have a little knowledge now of how the world of crypto works. All thanks to Binance. I recommend this app to everyone. I would love to have someone to teach me how to become rich on the app without deposit
2024-03-20 11:27:38,"Thank you for your response. Another challenge I'm having in the app is not able to disable my dual investment auto compound. Given the fact that Nigerians can't access binance website, and the auto compound can't be edited via the app"

2024-03-19 10:40:39,"Every time when there are unusual movements in the market, the system gives an anomaly error, and I can't make transactions and I lose money. Horrible"
2024-04-12 06:24:03,"Definitely your having problems now. Anytime update and when updated there will be limited development. 🥵 This problem ""limited anormally"" must be fixed!"
2024-03-18 14:16:47,Please prompt a message when selecting zen payment in which to inform users who are not familiar with zen to check or verify zen account because the funds may be there and additional fees may be applied in 3rd party payment procesor. I have selected zen because it was stated that there are no fees. I would've selected bank transfer and the fees would have been much lower. It may be misleading. Thanks for understanding
2024-04-03 03:59:27,"I don't like the fact that I can no longer open the app anytime I want, it keep on saying network anomaly please try again so annoying"

2024-02-19 19:07:22,"Very good application, but the worst customer service [Edited after their reply] You just answered my rating 3 years later, telling me to open a ticket and solve my problem dated 3 years ago. Confirmation level +999. Good job! You just lost one more star."
2024-02-29 19:14:15,"The app has been having issues loading completely and it always seems like it'll load till eternity as after opening the app, about 85% of the app's interface goes blank."
2024-01-27 09:51:52,"After the last update it asks me to login everytime I try to open the app. And most important I lost access to my wallet in the app. When I try to access it, it asks me to log in again and after it says ""Network unreachable"". PS: Had to uninstall and install again the app. PS: 01.2024 I would like to thank the developer team for being so prompt in following up my problem. It only took them 3 years :)))"

2024-02-20 05:42:19,"The biggest and safest exchange, but the server connection is very slow, sometimes network anomalies, sometimes data malfunctions, Sometimes Crash, Sometimes the price chart doesn't work, deleting the cache is also useless. and even when I browse other exchanges such as Mexc, BingX, Bybit, Huobi, Gate, Kucoin etc. I didnt experience anything similar when I was on Binance. the servers there are much better and also the last price trade here is also very bad, they wick very far from the last price"
2024-01-20 18:45:50,"I just love it. There are numerous elements that set Binance apart from other programmes. I use it because it contains several currencies that are unavailable in other applications, and it is simple, safe, and significantly more affordable than others. It really is the greatest app for trading digital currencies."

2024-02-17 21:51:49,"it's a great app and has a great user interface. it's reliable and trusted. We would love to welcome more development and upgrades though, but so far so good, it's been a great app"
2024-03-21 18:40:30,"""System abnormality"" message while creating a Web3 wallet. Update: Thank you for trying to help. Unfortunately nothing from what you recommended fixed the issue. And your support chat is useless without a real support person. I found this issue happened also to someone 2-3 years ago, but no resolution is provided. Please tell your devs that the bug is back."
2024-03-24 20:44:16,"I’ve consistently utilized the Binance application and have been thoroughly impressed with its capabilities for managing my crypto trades.

2024-03-23 16:50:38,"Binance US stole $20 on my very first transfer to my coinbase wallet! They have USD withdrawals disabled, so you can't even withdraw any money to your bank account, so I tried to send $47 of Bitcoin to my coinbase wallet. When it arrived it was only $21.40! The transaction hashtag shows only a $5 fee & the preview said it would be less than $2 of binance charges. Shay in chat was no help ""we can't help."" This is theft! Binance literally stole $20 from me! This company deserves to be closed down!"
2024-03-23 11:11:30,The app is working well. But can you add the feature that help the app to pop up when new version is available for updating the app? This may help users to update the app without interuption.
2024-03-19 01:21:16,App is buggy and not working properly in Japan. Often doesn't show account balance unless I reinstall the app but then the issue persists.
2024-03-22 23:28:37,Last update broke it. It crashes a few second after opening it. Update: restarting the phone fixed it

2024-03-21 03:30:22,"BINANCE is still the most safest place to trade currencies but our old leaders don't want to give the young blood the future potential to embrace their destiny in this digital space.

2024-01-31 16:44:55,"I have been using binance for more than three years now, but for the past two weeks now it's giving me headech, the app refuses to open and when I tried several times to open they refused my withdrawal, I'm just frustrated now, I tried their support several times but couldn't solve it why, is there any other means I will communicate with them and they will hear my outcry please help"
2024-03-16 02:57:03,The app takes time 5minutes to10minutes to load/refresh when reopening it after a while despite a strong internet connection and updated version... It also takes time to fill in an order when there is a market sideways trade.
2024-02-18 15:50:41,The busd/zar is wrong when trying to purchase using debit card. They are charging a much higher amount. Incorrect live price shown. No assistance from feedback

2024-02-21 11:48:12,It's a best place for scammers to take the money without the fear of chargebacks. Binance increased the rate of scams in the market. And once you've been scammed the support team will give you a long paragraphs to red and contact your local legal department. The worst things...
2024-02-21 19:07:44,"You guys were doing alright at first but since this month binance has been giving headaches... your platform hasn't been working properly I can't even get in the app it keeps saying connection issues but my connection is working properly please fix this, I can't even trade"

2024-03-04 06:47:22,"Very bad experience while signing up on binance, of face identification the app can't detect my face and says, avoid side light and back lights, even no lightd there and picture capturing was very clear, wrost app i ever seen"
2024-03-16 16:42:01,"It's good update, but the experience of dealing with discover, announcements and live, still not good enough like in other platforms."
2024-02-06 02:05:21,"Okay, the Web3 Wallet has been modified and some issues have been fixed and the application is now working well. I hope it continues like this. I will adjust the rating. Thanks a lot 👍"
2024-03-09 13:34:50,"the truth is that app for 2022 was the best from this please improve the features coz some times it shows blank space and take long time to up load the system, its wasting our time for trading 😭😭😥😢 it take alot of time to up load why"

2024-01-31 01:20:08,"It's been a while I use the account and I even changed phone, I don't even remember having an authentication enabled, now I am finding it hard to login, because it's requesting for authentication code from authentication app, which I don't recognize, what do I do?"
2024-03-12 19:33:15,Site will not let me sign in to withdrawal my fund since I am in the US. Support bot does not help my issue. I haven't been able to sign in for 5 years. I'm trying to reset my security verification to disable 2FA and it just has a loading icon. I really need to sign in!
2024-03-04 15:32:54,"Giving this app a 1 star because they are fraud I woke up one Sunday to see my account logged out and when I tried logging got the message ""account not found"" After series of trials to contact the customer care, they insisted that the account was deleted from users end I showed them all evidence that it was not possible My app wasn't even open at time, if it was hacked, there was no email received on the mail Then they tell me to contact authorities for them to escalate it U guys are a big fraud"
2024-02-19 13:16:30,"The Binance app offers a user-friendly interface for seamless cryptocurrency trading on the go. With robust security features and a wide range of available assets, it's a convenient choice for both beginners and experienced traders."
2024-03-03 10:07:31,"This app was not working for me, I tried so many times, nothing happened all the a forth trying to restart the app. They still ask me for documents, what do you need my documents for ?"
2024-01-30 10:46:53,"No...no problem so far, but I just need more training on binance(how to fully operate on it and so on)I want to understand all the features of binance...because it is the only trustworthy crypto app so far,from my personal views and experience,Although I have been scammed with my 13.00 USD by so called jane jessica"
2024-02-02 01:20:47,A lot of the indicators available in the desktop version are not included in the app making it less convenient than what its supposed to do as a mobile app.
2024-02-12 07:19:20,"It's a game-changer app in crypto trading, with its user-friendly interface, robust security and wide range of features, it's a must-have for any enthusiast. Highly recommended."
2024-02-19 16:19:28,"Not bad at all, but the new update of Binance is giving me headache. The coin I always marking as my favourite is no longer there in my favourite folder, everyday I use to add them, but after few hours when I visited the app back, they are no longer there. Not good at all."
2024-03-05 15:16:16,"Hello Binance team I have been encountering this problem for a while now ""Network anomaly, please try again"". I have a strong connection but still doesn't allow me to login sometimes. Please you have to see through this situation."
2024-02-22 20:01:29,"I love the community created within the app. You can chat with any crypto trader, learn new strategies, and be updated on the latest information going on around the various ecosystem in the crypto space. The reasons are I can't give 5 stars; 1. The community is not regulated some content violates the regulations yet they go unchecked. 2. The time for the intervention of customer care is too long as regarding the p2p irregularities 2hrs"
2024-02-06 19:04:22,Pls note that i have uninstalled it and installed again so i have no cash files And i tried again with same error I also ttried the same from website and when i click on take photo with camera i got a similar error (Camera Access Denied) though i grant access to camera through browser settings So apparently u have some bugs in these areas BTW i have tried with 2 browsers and i got the same access camera error and a msg that i dont have VGA hw or drive to run CyberLink YouCam
2024-02-26 10:43:37,"Chats are so slow in P2P even with fast internet. I have messaged the seller and it's been 10 minutes since I sent the message and it's still not delivering, this needs to be fixed asap."
2024-02-16 15:23:02,The app itself is great but the charts need some polish. There should be indicators like in Tradingview and we should also be able to program our own indicators.
2024-02-15 09:22:16,"evan i am using the same device, same password, because i am travelling us area, bnb app is not able to recognize me and consequentelly they are blocking any transaction i intend to do. bnb, please fix it, grow up. tks."

2024-02-24 15:29:45,"I was playing a game and I died so I watched an ad to revive, but your dumb ad took me to the playstore without my consent, closing my game and making me lose the ad reward and time. Pick better advertisers, my man."
2024-02-23 05:09:39,This website is very good and I like it very much but there is one thing in it that the newbie doesn't know enough so he wastes his money. Less than one to two dollars should be given first for free so that he learns the trade
2024-03-04 18:46:07,"Binance is a game-changer in cryptocurrency trading. Its user-friendly interface, vast selection of crypto currencies, and robust security measures make it my top choice.
