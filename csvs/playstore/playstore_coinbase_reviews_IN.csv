2024-04-15 12:06:57,"I have several issues: 1. I can no longer see my all-time balances, which has now slowed me down because I have to click each assest individually; 2. the app now makes us switch to Advanced for spot trades, but you can't see your other holdings, whereas before everything was in one place, and 3. I can't apply for the USDC crypto card. It will not allow me to put in my address or mailing address. I tried using my desktop as well. Customer service was of no help at all. Not as user friendly."
2024-04-14 20:25:25,"It is impossible to place a trade using the Advanced Trade feature. The latency is so bad that the app just locks up whenever attempting to interact with the Buy or Sell page. I choose market order, and after a great deal of lag (over 3 minutes), the market order page displays. Then, when I try to type in the dollar amount I would like to sell or purchase, there is another few minutes of lag before the keyboard interface even displays. Then it freezes altogether. It's been like this for months."
2024-04-12 13:59:12,"Love the cancel all transactions (orders). Dont like that you can not turn phone sideways to see graph of BTC for example. Fees are high. Very fast and responsive. Love that in portfolio view you can see which coins are in the green and red, it would be better inprovement to see how much % they went up or down. In the spot menu it would be nice to see what price you bought something without going the extra step to order history. Sell all coins would be nice feature if market takes a nose dive."
2024-04-13 02:48:27,"The app is a little confusing to use now that it changed slightly. But, it updates transactions quickly. It only tells you your purchase amount using the debit card, not where you shopped. Crypto is easy to buy and the rates are all listed to help you make a decision. I wish it gave a warning when it your balance is low. It us easy to transfer money into your account. I like the learn section if the app."
2024-04-11 04:21:10,"I can't sign in. The app on first launch gives you an intro screen to either open an account, browse, or up in the top corner, to sign in. Upon selecting the option to sign in, it opens an in-app browser which takes you to the coinbase website to sign in. I've jumped through all the hoops several times, verifying, with glitches galore like multiple sent requests, to use an email link to verify. Once that actually works, you get a spinning wheel of death. Long story short, I can't sing into app."
2024-04-15 02:25:05,"Was fantastic for the longest time, but now, charts are broken, and has been since the crash on March 12th or 13th. Hasn't corrected in over a month now, also, decimal errors all the time, inconsistent interface with %s. Fix my charts and i'd fix my rating. I have uninstalled/reinstalled to no avail."
2024-04-07 15:51:39,"Over time I have noticed features are slowly disappearing from the free version of the app. I feel like they're slowly pushing everyone to pay so they can see all the things that used to be free. I love this app and I have used it as my main investing platform but I don't like that they're taking away from those of us who aren't looking to spend unnecessarily on a paid version when it's impractical. I miss seeing my ""All time"" balance for my assets, which was a new draw back, and others gone too"
2024-04-15 15:37:09,"I always have to verify my identity, I could only buy not sell. it took way to long, months for help in customer support. they also have no number to call for any support. and only gibe you 7 minutes to respond when they and texting you back. and always shut off when you are trying to send the pictures to verify. it is very unreasonab length of time to navigate the things they are asking from you. I would never reccomend this platform."
2024-04-10 08:10:54,"I like the earlier versions of Coinbase a lot better actually. They weren't nearly as reliant on the influence, use or interfacing of other connected platforms. One stop one shop is more my theory. If it is connected and does something great, awesome, doesn't mean I want to have to interface and have to learn everybody new platforms just to move and keep my money secure while earning all potential profits available to me at every moment. Calculate and make and trade for those moments."
2024-04-16 05:34:39,"Congratulations Coinbase on for years running, having the worst customer support I've ever experienced. $200+ in fees paid already, yet 2 months waiting to resolve the issue caused by your systems- preventing me from being able to send my assets to my wallet or buy anything else. Wish I could explain the issue on this review but only 500 characters. I'd just recommend to everyone, stay far, far away from this exchange. Nice interface but wow, 8 customer support exchanges and still unresolved."
2024-04-15 16:25:16,"*** updated review | apr 2024 *** Many changes to improve UI appreciated, but app nearly unusuable for real investment management due to long data load times. I have to use a separate app to track prices, and often times my trades will time out. Dont blame the network, either... it happens everywhere, and on multiple sevices. ********************************** Works well enough. Some minor UI frustrations, limited reporting, etc. Overall good but plenty of room to grow still as well."
2024-03-08 05:00:22,"TNT: Hello all again, I am rating on the latest installment of quest, it is with out a doubt really nice to be able to complete them but I can't and haven't been. I was able to start them but not finish them. I get it, you squad is adding all kinds of new features, and different ways to interact with the wallet. But, whenever y'all get time to fix this issue I'd greatly appreciate it. Oh, and it's been, almost six months, that this has been happening. Hoping it would gotten fixed🤔."
2024-03-14 23:14:43,"The structure of your data changes without explanation: Under 'My Assets,' I like to see the gain or loss percentage accompanied by the current price. Now (and this has happened several times), I see the balance I own of each coin and the quantity of coins. This appears to change on a whim and is not an option in the settings. When it changes this way, I have to select each asset to see if I have lost or gained. It was nice to see, at a glance, the current condition of the market."
2024-03-04 06:24:10,"It's ok and has plenty of features but the layout is broken for UK users. When in Advanced mode viewing a pair, the Buy/Sell banner at the bottom of the screen covers the history section and you're not able to scroll down easily unless you use a very small area of the screen. I think this hasn't been addressed since the blue warning banner was added, pushing everything down. It's also really frustrating that this warning can't be dismissed as it permanently takes up a fifth of the view."
2024-02-19 23:15:20,"Great app, but the latest update is atrocious. It's a classic case of fixing something that was not broken and ending up with a worse product for no reason. Taking away the advanced trade and making it standalone makes 0 sense and just makes the app tedious for no reason. It was perfect before but you had to ""fix"" it. Change it back immediately. STOP RELEASING UPDATES FOR THE SAKE OF UPDATES. Every time I open the app now it comes up with that stupid box to change views from advanced to regular."
2024-03-18 11:26:05,"I've enjoyed trading on Coinbase since 2018. Back then I didn't mind how primitive the mobile options were, however the current version of the app is a step down from versions I've seen last year. My portfolio is not showing me a line graph for my daily P/L or my lifetime P/L like it used to. I also find the app a lot less intuitive, than it has been in previous versions, and I don't feel confident making any trades other than market buys from my app."
2024-01-27 12:39:06,"The app has had ""bug"" for the past several MONTHS. I open the app up and I can't see my balance whatsoever, It's just several black dots. When I reached out about this issue the support team told me that I should try using a computer. When I asked if they were aware of the issue and if they had any plans on correcting it they ignored me and closed the chat. Well, it's been months now, still can't see my balance when using my phone."
2024-04-02 12:50:45,"For the past 2 months this app is basically unusable for spot trading. Clicking buy or sell results in lag and a wait of 1-2 minutes before a window pops up, then it takes another minute for any box selected to prompt the keyboard, then another laggy slow struggle to input numbers, then if all that works the system often crashes completely. This is basically unusable and my funds are going to other apps now sadly. No one can trade with these circumstances, it is broken."
2024-03-14 17:36:42,"This latest update is horrible. I too am having issues with glitches trying to get basic info such as price graphs, much less trying to complete trades in the moment. The worse part of the upgrade that needs to come back is the feature that allowed you to see the execution price of the trade without having to find the order and open it. Please bring back the execution price in the summaries."
2024-03-21 23:28:55,Opened account before the whole verification process was mandatory. Don't like that I need to send in a photo of my driver's license and then record a video of myself just to be able to log in to get my W2s. I should have been given the option to transfer money out and get mailed my tax documents and close my account without sending this to them. I understand verification security but I would have never signed up if this was required to begin with.
2024-03-26 14:27:35,"Can't imagine trading with this app. I use advanced trader mode to monitor only. Latest update removed mini charts from watchlist (Was same as desktop browser). Watchlist/pair list can't be sorted by gain, price, or name anymore. Order book and depth charts still aren't adjustable. 8 seconds lag when loading charts on 5g wifi. It doesn't swipe to next in list like Webull. You have to exit and wait for it to load again. Simple mode has better stats on holdings, so you have to switch modes."
2024-03-15 20:23:02,"It lacks the clarity, especially when buying. E.g. why is price to buy a crypto higher than the one shown on home screen - it's not clear where the difference is coming from. Notifications are a mess. In Android app settings I cannot set only certain notifications I would like to receive, the names of notifications are identical and they say nothing. In app itself I cannot set notifications for specific values of certain currencies."
2024-02-29 11:41:08,"They ask for a clear photo for the identity verification, but it's the app that destroys the photo's quality. The phone is good, the camera works perfectly, but after the photo is taken, THE APP destroys its quality. So, I cannot get verified, and it's their fault. How is an app useful if the main verification needed for most interesting functionalities is literally not possible..."
2024-03-29 14:08:34,"Great place to find all sorts of crypto, but if you don't mind fees, then this is the platform for you. Shouldn't cost anything to convert coins from one to another, along with fees to buy and sell. Seems excessive to me, I haven't sent coins yet, and I'm sure it also costs money. Not looking to stay on here, there are better brokerages."
2024-03-15 23:33:20,"This app was fine when I first used it but for over a month now, I can't sign in. I have unistalled and reinstalled it countless times, I have cleared the cache, I have tried everything and all I get as a reward is an infuriating blue spinning wheel. This is a ludicrous joke of an app! It took another app update to fix this problem but since then everything has been OK, touch wood."
2024-03-19 10:48:16,"It's not working well. I've tried reaching out customer service, but no luck, no one has ever answered the texts, they just close the case. The app doesn't allow me some basic features such as setting up account all the way or such as adding a payment method for no reason what so ever. The worst part is that you can't get any help no matter how hard you try."
2024-03-20 21:29:23,"The app is a bit clunkier than the pc browser experience, but it does have more ""learn and earn"" options (I guess the browser version hasn't been updated in some time). Coinbase is beginner friendly, but the trading fees are kind of high. It's not bad but it's not the best. I'd still recommend for beginners."
2024-03-24 06:22:54,"User friendly to buy and sell crypto. But using this app for about 3 years, the downsides start growing as you start growing. The use of advanced charts help but their system for your porfoilio is lacking. (The display for gain, loss, avg cost, weird graph display, the list can go on) Some features seem to get laggy over extended periods of time or high volume on high traffic days. The app i believe is great for people who want to get their feet wet in crypto. Just lacks efficient display."
2024-01-25 23:50:17,"This is getting ridiculous.. Not only does the app force close after every transaction on the OTC side, but now on the advanced side it won't even show me candlestick charts. I had made it all the way to the third tier of trading volume but clearly there needs to be some reinvestment of all those fees into your struggling infrastructure. I NEVER had issues like this on Binance. And yes - I've done all of your troubleshooting steps- but reinstalling a broken app isn't going to fix it, obviously."
2024-04-12 04:04:35,Changed my phone number and absolutely impossible to access my account. Verified my identity twice and it still won't let me login without some long passcode that I do not have. Unable to reach any sort of live support it's all bots and text articles that are not helpful. Plenty of other digital currency wallets that work better and have decent customer service. Just wish I could close my account but cannot reach anyone. Don't bother replying. Uninstalling now.
2024-01-28 14:57:30,"Can't pass identity check, before I upload anything, when I have to select driver license, it goes to the camera and it says ""something went wrong"" with a toast dialog. The app has the permission to use camera and photos. Ok that's fixed. Now I get a pop up that tells me to confim my information, I enter the app and it's a blank screen with a round arrow in the center."
2024-01-27 16:59:47,"This app has been great for me for the most part, until the latest update on 1/19/2024. Since then, no charts will display in advanced mode. I've reinstalled the app multiple times, updated my phone, dumped caches and app data...all kinds of troubleshooting, and finally contacted support only to be told ""the app isn't optimized for your phone yet"" (a galaxy S22 ultra on which I've been using coinbase without issue for at least a year). Please fix this! The app is useless w/o charts!"
2024-03-05 22:49:35,"Yes, the app allows you to buy crypto, yes it has good features and I like Advanced Trading. But, wow, does this app have incredibly bad performance issues. It is incredibly laggy and buggy. It's very frustrating when I go to place a buy order, and after all the lags, the price moves up 3%. Please please fix this"
2024-03-09 07:19:18,"They have the worst customer service ever. They asked me to update my address but they are too busy to review my update or submitted documents. So they froze my account until my turn comes! And I have been waiting months! There is no one to talk to since they don’t take calls from outside the US or from my territory. As for the app, I don't understand why it doesn't give the unit cost per coin based on my transaction history. They also don't post the profit or loss for account or the trading."
2024-03-08 02:11:20,"With all the heavy traffic in the markets the mobile app functionality is so degraded that it makes it barely useful. I have no access (except on my laptop) to the numbers of coins I have, or their value, or the change in the values in my account. All I get is the price per any coin or token. Used to be a good app - 5 stars."
2024-03-02 20:10:29,"While I do really like coinbase as a whole, because of the convenient all-in-one setup they have. The limiting of the amount of crypto you can buy each week is just stupid. Many times I've had money but couldn't make a purchase due to the limits. If that was changed then I'd give it a higher rating. I know it's probably to help avoid fraud or something but it's just super inconvenient sometimes and irritating. Other than that it's a pretty good wallet."
2024-02-22 11:33:09,"Terrible app, terrible support. Send two transaction and got an error, then for some reasons they were confirmed, asked to cancel it because of i got the error and didn't think that it'll be finished, support told me just no, we cannot do it. I was charged on 80$ just because of technical error. Great!"
2024-03-05 13:45:08,"New update of the app is horrible!! 50٪ of the time there are glitches, it won't log on, something won't open when finally in the app, inaccurate amount showing when trying to cash out, etc. Why change something when there wasn't anything wrong with the old app. STOP FORCING UPDATES THAT AREN'T NEEDED. Can't wait to get my money out, done with this nonsense. I have reached out to support several times & get the same answer. ""Let me look into, have you tried deleting the app & reinstalling?"" Yes"
2024-03-05 21:28:00,"All the sudden I cant trade due to connection issues, tried 5G, tried wifi, tried on another device and carrier. Support is just a robot that goes in circles. Very sus of you coinbase. Edit to reply: No thanks your in app support chain should have worked. You came back up long enough for me to cashout after losing 10 more points and all trust for your platform. Going with a platform that didnt just mysteriously crash during a large sell off."
2024-03-22 20:56:57,"Biggest POS use a different app. I created an account, jumped through all the hoops to add my bank, then purchased $50 worth of bitcoin. 1 day later it told me my bank reversed it and I have 5 days to pay. So I added a paypal account in doing so said i couldn't pay this with credit card and asked to add debit which I did after setup I tried to pay with it but it doesnt show up as a payment method. So I added the debit card directly again doesnt show. Help desk is hour+ wait. Not worth it!"
2024-03-07 13:09:17,"Frequent crashes and sloppy user interface that doesn't make much sense, and they keep changing it for the worse. Edited to add: this is the very first time I've ever heard back from Coinbase and I've sent them numerous emails for support and never heard back. They don't care to support you if you have issues accessing thousands of your own money, but care when they look bad publicly."
2024-03-20 12:19:55,"Annoyed me for the LAST time!! ...They ask me for verification EVERY single login just because their customer support is too lazy to check the FIRST TIME I sent verification- they say ""you haven't verified your identity yet"" and I can't even use this app to buy and trade with new funds... I haven't been able to in a long while. I've been putting up with this for over a year, and I don't know why... GOOD RIDDANCE"
2024-02-23 08:54:19,"Honestly, it's a great exchange. Mind it, I've had problems, like alot or people. For me the length of time it takes customer service to resolve the issue, takes alot longer than some other exchanges. That being said, I've never had an issue go unresolved with Coinbase. That speaks volumes. So, needless to say, it's a good,fast (deposits/withdrawals, buy/sell) user friendly exchange,"
2024-03-08 21:09:04,"Submitted id, pp and drivers license. Still got emailed saying unable to verify account. Why do u need a drivers license for a crypto trading account? Update again- went to the link provided below. Typed in everything including the verification code from the email. Clicked submit and still nothing happened! Whole thing a very draggy painful process. Very poor. Update again - Entered the verification code and clicked submit.. Nothing happened. Tried it 3 times. Pls get someone to contact me"
2024-02-02 15:26:55,"Some coin charts are not showing up, coins transaction history is not showing anymore. When I open the app is just a black screen. Assets page comes up with and error and doesn't display my assets. Everything got worse in the past 2 years with this app. And I lost 90% of my investments. Don't bother making an account on coinbase. Maaaannn.... even now I ma not able to sign in, I tried on different phones, whe I press sign in button it gives me error."
2024-03-07 06:51:10,"App suddenly tells me that my device is not supported even though I have the required Android version and there has been no update. Thanfully I can get it working on Bluestacks emulator, but this extremely frustrating and concerning, especially since you can only confirm Coinbase Card transactions via the app, it's not possible via the website as far as I know."
2024-03-28 18:59:59,"The only customer service they have is a chat bot that doesn't understand basic questions. The app hits you with hidden fees for everything. They keep responding with this help page on negative comments, but it's a joke. I've been trying the phone number for 3 days and tried all the options. It keeps saying chat over and over, higher than normal call volume, then just hangs up. It is the most frustrating call line ever, so I def would not trust this app with a large amount of $!"
2024-02-15 23:15:58,"Since a few days ago the app won't even load. first it signed me out I had to jump through hoops to log back in, after a day it stopped working completely. Won't even make it to the log in prompt. I've cleared my cache and storage and re installed still nothing. It's scary to have your money tied to an unreliable app like this"
2024-03-29 15:29:48,"Installed app, launched it, pressed Sign In. Error: Something went wrong. There was a problem while launching Sign In. Please try again. Result: cannot sign in. Waited for a few days, now there was an update. Updated app, encountered same error. Unacceptable... Update: Developer reply just shows how much they care... The app has 1.5 ⭐ on the store, everybody complains but they act like there must be an issue on my side and I should waste time to raise a ticket. Btw, error still occurs."
2024-03-04 18:24:31,"Full market on and platform freezes a lot, you can not operate: get into a good buy or exit when prices are dropping. To make you feel better your balance suddenly goes to zero. Also can't customize price alerts to what you need. In the US you are stuck with this. Unbelievable. One star because I can't give up on them. I need this to work."
2024-03-01 02:30:08,"I am so sick and tired of this app. Every, single, time you need to log in, you can expect hundreds of attempts, each time making it to the ""2-step verification"", begging for a Google passkey, completing it, and going right back to the log in screen. This is a completely broken app with my money still left inside. Useless trash I wish I never downloaded."
2024-04-08 08:56:38,"!!!!!!!SNEAKY APP BE WARNED!!!!!!! When buying coins the app defaults to USDC instead of the USD you have in the app, and if you have a bank account linked to the app it automatically deposits the funds from your bank to buy USDC then make whatever transaction you were originally trying to make. Imagine my FRUSTRATION when I was trying to quickly make a limit order only to find 2500$ in pointless USDC in my coinbase account. Twice this has happened it's absolutely ridiculous, cashing out buhbye."
2024-02-28 19:38:49,"If you lock your account, your money is gone. Logging back into is impossible, as you need to take a photo of your ID, and the app camera doesn't work. I've tried to use it from the app (permissions enabled, of course), from the mobile website, and from a desktop, and no camera works. Customer service didn't help either. Only use this app if you want to lose access to your money"
2024-03-13 23:54:24,"Transactions have been fast and accurate. However, it takes a while to figure out the app. If you trade fairly often you will be ok after it becomes routine. If you are an infrequent trader, you will tear your hair out relearning each time, where to look for simple stuff. A tutorial would be very helpful."
2024-04-15 14:06:48,"As of a few days ago my phone app no longer shows any of my balances, what is going on?? It shows +******* instead my dollar amounts for all of my balances, recent transactions etc... It works fine on my laptop, and I've used this app for years without problems."
2024-04-13 13:36:54,"Overall CB mobile has been a pleasant experience for me. The app will freeze at times, but hitting the back button or refreshing normally does the trick. Fees are acceptable. Data tends to be accurate also. Keep up the good work guys!"
2024-04-11 02:08:27,it's the only place I can get free crypto just for learning about crypto. it's a win win situation. I just really wish they would unlock the rest of the rewards so I can get more free crypto. I've been on the waiting list for a couple of weeks now. just seems too long. I would give it a 5 if they would let me earn more crypto instead of just being on the waiting list.... Update!! they have added plenty of learn and earn chances so I gave them 5 stars.
2024-04-11 03:36:11,"seems like they outsource alot of if not all customer service. trades feel like some type of a.i. is guiding or what is used somehow. charts could offer more accuracy. I don't like how they can offer a currency and choose to leave you dead stuck and delist it. so, can't say it's a bad app. but they need to get there ""tweaks & updates"" togather and stop changing they're app and web as I feel it confuses many"
2024-04-10 07:34:20,"I absolutely love Coinbase! The perfect introduction to cryptocurrency! Earn real money as learn about crypto! It actually does cash out in minutes! You can view prices of most cryptocurrencies, tokens, and NFTs all in one place and can buy, sell, trade, convert, stake, and more seamlessly. Connect with Coinbase Wallet, DeFi, web3, and explore apps on different block chains. Earn free money and watch it grow passively!"
2024-04-10 05:50:07,"They advertised a £5 credit for first-time sign-ups in the UK, but there's no indication of it being honored or any straightforward means to reach customer service for clarification. Update: Still not able to get an answer about this promotion from Coinbase UK."
2024-04-05 10:50:13,"DO NOT USE COINBASE. There are so many better apps out there, stay away from this one. The fees are nuts! You get charged aggressive fees on top of a purchase and sell spread. Their conversions are insane. For example, you're supposed to be able to convert $1 into one Tether yet, I converted $500 into Tether but by the next morning, I could only get $494 from my Tether. This app sucks, stay away. Kraken Pro is much better."
2024-04-04 08:58:27,"Won't allow me to add my payment method, debit card, my bank allows crypto purchasing, details are correct just keep getting incorrect details, it's not a prepaid or business card either, and the chat help is useless as it's a bot that gives absolutely zero help, why do companies think a bot is better than a human 🙄 just tried to email support, that no longer works 🙄 and the support page has no actual raise a ticket option, absolute shambles of an app zero stars"
2024-04-09 06:08:43,"I would change the rating but I need to have the code I've been trying to send to my account to actually work. I've tried on all the other Coinbase apps and it works perfectly fine. This is the app I need to have work now and I can't get that to happen if I can't even sign in. It keeps telling me invalid credentials when I'm putting in the same exact password as the other Coinbase applications. I really want this to be resolved, if someone could help me I'd change this rating to five stars."
2024-03-28 00:24:16,"App won't let me login. It keeps bugging me to use a pass key even though I already have an authenticator. No matter what I do, it won't let me in. I never had this problem before they started trying to enhance the security features. App was good before that."
2024-04-09 16:25:35,"despite people complaining about the app i ve actually found it one of the best when it comes to buying/selling ur assets. Low fees, fast processing times. Tried 5 apps with 4 - 5 stars only to be surprised by the enourmous fees and a lot of them, cant even breathe without paying a fee in those. 5/5 stars would give more if i could"
2024-04-08 03:06:37,I only downloaded this app so I could play a online game and I wasn't able to add to my game nor cash out. Kept telling me either amount to large or bank unlinked. If it's my money no matter how much it is I should be able to transfer it anywhere I want. And it should be my choice to unlink my bank. Plus all the fees to do anything in it. I think this app is just another way to rob people of their money
2024-04-09 02:38:50,"Pretty great app to use for crypto. Great for beginners such as myself as it teaches you along the way which has been very helpful! Don't like the very few fees for sending and buying but I guess thats to be expected. Good app though, try it out! Also, they give out freebies!"
2024-04-10 23:18:03,"Great platform for trading and learning but some hiccups with user-friendliness and fees are a bit of a headache. But rewards for learning make up for it in my opinion and I learned a lot from the lessons they have. 10/10 but I wish they made it simpler to figure out. Still my favorite platform to this day, I just avoid ETH."
2024-03-16 13:50:11,"The app flat out doesn't work anymore. I have to use the browser version. Literally every time I open the app it pops up with the ""Something Went Wrong"" message. It tells you to complete sign in on a browser but still never let's me on the app one I do. What's the point in having an app if it never works?"
2024-04-15 07:56:49,"I did have it at 5 stars until the last 2 updates. I understand that y'all want to update your app , but s TEST THE NEW VERSION EXTENSIVELY before releasing it. It used to work good, until the last month and a half. I'm in IT and know how programming etc works. Get QUALIFIED DEVELOPERS. When I use an APP extensively every day like I do Coinbase, which handles MY MONEY it has better work flawlessly. It stalls every use , then reboot phone. Tested on 4 devices. I want two free months refunded."
2024-04-02 15:31:33,"Terrible, if I could give it zero stars I would. The customer representatives cannot do anything worthwhile to help. For three months, I have been unable to transact and I keep being told to wait a month. I tried to withdraw and the app prevents me. Upon contacting customer support again, I was told to wait a month or sell my assets. I definitely won't be recommending from now on. I have already reached out to support 4 times and got the same response, wait a month and try again."
2024-04-09 15:58:52,"When buying or selling, the buy or sell doesn't match the actual asset price. For E.g, the Bitcoin price will be $70k, but when I go to sell, the sell price is $68,500. When I'm buying, it'll be at $71.500. Never the actual price displayed!! Price manipulation is BAD BUSINESS!! I called the # they provided. I did everything they asked to resolve the problem, but they insisted my info is incorrect, lol. NO HELP WAS GIVEN, sadly. Customer service was very rude!!! Very bad experience! What a shame!"
2024-03-25 18:46:13,"The app is easy to use. The 2FA is awful. If they send a code, it's ten minutes after I requested it, which will no longer work. They let me buy Bitcoin, but I can't trade it until after 8 days. Then it depreciates in value, so I have to buy more to cover the purchase I want, then the cycle repeats. Not easy to get support with either."
2024-04-14 20:04:14,As bad as it gets. No way to see your cost average. Extreme fees. No tax statement. Really are you expecting me to download all transactions and do it manually? That's basic functionality that all trading platforms offer. Wish I never got into crypto...
2024-04-08 17:25:40,No theft so far but I have some strong indication that the currency exchange is on a private server and there is some interception math that goes on in a hidden fashion. Steals some profits on exchange rate hikes and decreases. Possible that lots of server switching happens. Cyber criminal havens... Coinbase is no longer honorable entirely.
2024-04-05 11:24:00,"App is fine. Web and app looks fancy. However, the platform itself is terrible. Contacted support and filed a complaint to resolve my issues. Don't invest here. Edit: No, I won't submit another request for customer support. My account is currently closing. You have lost me as a customer."
2024-04-10 19:26:01,App Used to be okay. Now you can't see the screen due to a great big warning notice taking up a third of the screen!! Says it might be a bit risky and you might lose your money. you cannot get rid of it Many users on Reddit say the same. It's been going on for months. When I contacted customer support today they were useless pretending they knew nothing about it and then they cut me off. I contacted them again and it was like speaking to a 2-year-old. I give up I shall be removing my money.
2024-04-12 11:42:18,"It feels like a scam compared to other exchanges. The fees and having to buy ether to do anything with their wallet, just feels like a money pit. I've moved all my coins off and am now trying to close my account. But because there is few cents worth of Ether in my wallet (usually required for a wallet), I can't close!!"
2024-04-06 12:27:27,"Can't login into the Coinbase app anymore. ""Connection trouble"" I re-installed the app and tried a different phone, same problem. I have to use a browser on the laptop now. Update: 2 tears later, I still can't login into the Coinbase app. Fresh install of the app. I can login in the browser with no issues. I see others have the same problem. Worst crypto app."
2024-04-09 14:46:54,"Too many hidden hoops & higher fees. Can't transfer funds until they have held them for a week even though the fees are higher than most. They don't display the wait times until after you committed to the transaction. Won't use them again Update So now my BTC is ""locked up"" and I can't transfer it to an external wallet. I will never use them again once I get my money out"
2024-04-12 01:19:34,"This app is very slow and overrated, also I hope they update their tax forms so you don't have to pay for a subscription for them to make a easier way to file your taxes. Because you shouldn't have to pay for (coinbase one) when we're already getting ripped off on Market prices with a 5% collar at least unless you know how to make buy orders😂"
2024-04-14 03:34:10,"Keep track of your performance page, where it gives the average price, coinbase tries to hide this page from you, and I noticed this. I noticed that my average price changed without me purchasing any crypto when I queried about it from coinbase from where it's outsourced... magically, the average price reverted to its original price, I recorded it and also the conversations. Everyone much keep an eye on this, because if they change your average, and the crypto goes up, someone can easily profit"
2024-04-11 00:38:12,"So far, no major issues and fees are fair. I hope that coinbase is updated to stop signing out every couple of days! It's extremely inconvenient, especially when I'm using the same device and no need for the extra hassle."
2024-04-14 07:21:32,Hands down the best and most informative app for joining an online brokerage firm. Their app takes the new investor into the utmost consideration with all there functions wall to wall being user friendly and easy to grasp even for people completely new to investing. They even provide monetized incentives for you to read there lessons. Most of which are 5 min. or less and end with a short quiz upon which you'll be rewarded.
2024-04-12 02:43:55,"Can't believe how easy it's become since the last bull run. Such a pleasure to use for buying, swapping, transferring, bridging etc. The crypto world is becoming easier and more accessible than ever."
2024-04-13 08:48:06,They locked my account and I have a sizeable sum of money there. The app won't even allow me to take a picture of my ID to verify identity. The button to allow camera access is disabled. It prompts me to allow camera access even though it's already enabled.
2024-04-15 06:50:44,"I use to be quite satisfied with this app up until the past year or so. Fees on cashing out, purchasing, etc are outrageous. Seems I've had to go back and review some account information because support will say that my assests are locked until I make a repayment on a failed transaction. Not as trusting as I once was with Coinbase. Unfortunate"
2024-04-15 09:24:17,"Did a bunch of research, found a couple winning meme coins at low prices.... Just waiting to bounce.... Would NOT let me purchase them with some BS about ""Withdrawal amount too low"" in red! Made NO sense! I tried and tried! Got support on the line, told me to try and buy MORE! So I deposited more.... STILL ""withdrawal amount too low!"" I gave up. The next day, I saw they had purchased AFTER the bounce! So now I'm in at a dead level.... Not making anything! NOT HAPPY!"
2024-04-13 07:34:26,"I love app, easy to use and understand. Only thing I'd change is the ability to make font larger, I'm partially blind, would help a lot. But love the app and coinbase has been my go to for years."
2024-04-14 18:28:50,"Not sure where to start. I just wanted to invest and withdraw, simple yes!? Well my experience with this platform has been to say the least awful. Blocked at every step. THE QORAT PKATFORM EVER!!! If I would have been blocked at withdrawal I would understand but they block you at investing. MY ADVICE : START VERY SMALL if you decide to use so you don't lose money due to market fluctuations but to the platform. You will see what I mean if you decide to go with them."
2024-04-13 12:13:07,"App is so slow!!! The lag just even trying to load simple interfaces is a joke how can you expect people to want to use this platform when performing simple actions is made difficult by lag and slow load times. Sort it out coinbase you are making sickening money from people using your exchange, your charges are higher than everyone else and yet you cant even make your app faster and better to use. Binance does not have these problems and is a far better user experience."
2024-04-05 22:12:10,"Security key login doesn't work. Can't login anymore. Works fine on web, so something is broken with the app. Also they don't like logins from VPNs. Their tech staff must still be working in the 1940s or something."
2024-04-10 14:37:12,great app but need a friendlier interface with better features compared with using binance app but the Australian interface with banking is great. fees are a little high. I would have given more stars if they add better charts functions.
2024-03-21 14:52:31,"I tend to like coinbase, but their consistent horrible customer service and glitchy app has drove me away. Right now I'm facing a never ending stake issue. Unstaking period is a month, but continue to earn rewards while unstaking and those rewards are automatically staked. This means I'm getting $.01 transactions everyday making taxes a nightmare. And it'll never end, there is no way. I've contacted support, but they are easily the worst support in human history. Don't use this service."
2024-03-11 22:19:21,Such a horrible experience. My account has been restricted from selling and doing any other transactions and I have tried multiple times to contact customer service and I keep receiving the wait time is more than an hour. Sure I I wait for over an hour to speak to an agent and ends up automatically closing the chat. I have submitted the necessary documents to verify identity. There's no wait to email customer service. I am very disappointed.
2024-03-05 06:20:00,"DO NOT USE THIS APPLICATION!! I couldn’t even pass the verification process properly due to constant problems in my wallet and the fact that they are simply unable to make the process quick and convenient. even technical support could not do anything after three requests for help were sent. I highly do not recommend wasting your time on this, just read other reviews"
2024-03-21 23:46:56,"Do not use this application at all. It is slow, delayed, so many continuous issues. Will try to make all payments come from your bank account instead of your balance in application. Also tries to charge your bank account multiple times a day to give multiple charges due to their technical failures and will cost you money. Worst crypto application out there. Lost hundreds due to ""technical issues"" with their SYSTEM not processing in DUE TIME."
2024-04-14 12:14:09,Horrible experience. Can't pay with PayPal as I'm given an error every time. Fees are outrageous and you are not given upfront warnings. Then when you are trying to convert currency to send funds you are only warned at the last second there is a $50 minimum to purchase currencies such as USDT. This app is nothing like it used to be.
2024-04-07 18:14:41,App is still almost unusable. Always hangs have to restart it 3x. Takes 20 minutes to deposit money. Don't even bother trying to get in or out of a position quick. Garbage
2024-02-15 03:55:46,"cannot sign-in in app, useless app. Also website is useless, once I saw, what happened to UI, I had to withdraw all my money back to never see that disaster ui again.. and had problem to find even that. Former Pro user, not to mention, this is like third time with Coinbase, when I had to move into its new platform/site, within few years. No thanks, enough is enough."
2024-03-16 18:45:31,"The something wrong with the proof of address check. I'm submitting multiple types of documents with the address present . And its being rejected. Update: If there was a lower score than one, I would give it. After finally managing the proof of address, it seems I cannot cash out, because my account is not eligible to hold a cash balance, for whatever reason. 2 hours wasted on speking customer support and nobody can do anything about it. I can buy with credit card or PayPal , but I no sell."
2024-03-08 01:36:43,"There are a lot of glitches, and it's next to impossible to get ahold of a person. They make it seem easy, and its not. It also seems like im being charged alot more fees then it tells me. When my account jumps $10 from a $2 fee its kinda noticeable. Id love if you guys had a phone number to call for support."
2024-02-29 09:41:37,"Very expensive to use and fees are not transparrent, you only find out the fee when you're about to do a transaction Update: coinbase website is just vague words. You only find out what they will charge you at the time of transaction, rather than a transparent table showing all fees like other providers do so that you can plan your investments."
2024-03-08 18:25:35,"Fun fact! The account setup doesn't work properly, stopping you from getting any promotion deal they told you about! Even more fun is their app support, which is so worthless that you can, and will have to find more help on reddit. The actual trading is fine. But you won't get proper support if something goes wrong and the app can and will malfunction without saying anything. And if it does that while you're trying to invest. Good luck."
2024-03-04 18:32:59,"In fact, the verification process is tedious. How can a government issued ID contain a home address? I don't even know the reason why they are rejecting my ID. The app itself doesn't allow us to take a clear picture. After taking it in the frame provided, the app expands it with a wider background. I think you should allow uploading of the ID instead of taking it directly to the app. Please, it is the same ID I used for my binance KYC verification. You can do better. Thanks"
2024-03-14 14:50:27,"Don't like it, keeps asking to verify I have uploaded almost 8 times my driver's license and it still has issue. Not sure how only coinbase cannot verify but other apps doesn't have any issues in verifying but they will let you buy the crypto such an odd thing. But you cannot send it.You should stop all activities people will stop installing this and avoid wasting their time. Really being a new user trying from yesterday to use an app and still doesn't works. Need to look for some good options."
2024-03-29 02:09:03,Easy to use app. Beginning freebies were nice. I don't like Coinbase because of the amount of fees (and then not being so upfront about it). A big plus is the annual interest for USDC though. Edit: Coinbase Advanced mode is a little less user-friendly interface (more official) but with much less fees. Save your money - TURN ON COINBASE ADVANCED!
2024-03-17 02:07:33,"App is easy to use. Charts suck. Would be nice if the high and low showing in the top left corner actually reflect the day it is. I notice a few inconsistencies with highs, lows, and % showing unless I long hold on the chart to see the day that is trading."
2024-02-20 01:55:05,"It has issues starting up. Whenever I start the app, I have to shut it down and restart it. It won't populate the screens correctly the first time. It also has trouble updating in the advanced trading, prices don't stay up to date at the same time. This is on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4."
2024-04-04 09:46:28,I enjoy using the platform. It's very simple and Coinbase was a wide variety of coins. The only thing I don't like about the platform is sending Cypto. This is the most difficult exchange to send out Cypto. Usually I have to try multiple times to send Cypto somewhere.
2024-04-10 04:00:40,"Bitcoin is stuck in their ""Vault."" When I authorize and move it out of the vault, the transaction gets auto canceled no matter how many times I approve it. Customer service is useless. I tried to get this fixed thru emails and calling, and they never fixed it."
2024-04-07 01:05:38,App has a bug keeps crashing. You can't hook a bank account up or bank card or wire transfer or PayPal account none of it works good luck with this app. Been broken for a month now. . Don't think their going to fix it.
2024-02-28 22:09:11,"This app ALWAYS just happens to be ""down"" when something is happening ( a crypto I own is crashing/skyrocketing) I literally can't use the app in the most important moments! I've definitely lost out on hundreds because of it Edit: unless you plans on making the app work better and giving me a few hundred bucks theres no point in me clicking on your link"
2024-03-24 18:23:28,"I'm loving it , easy to make use . I love sea few exchanges and this is by far the most user friendly especially with the coin base wallet attachment gives me access to more up and coming projects to invest in. I like buying and holding coins so this is the perfect exchange and platform to use it you want to just hold on to coins for the long term to unless ofcourse you want to sell which is also very easy to use with no mistake. I also like that when you buy you can clearly see the buy preview"
2024-01-24 18:10:33,"THANKS FOR STEALING MY MONEY. YOU A%&HOLES. I recently had a disappointing experience using Coinbase that resulted in financial losses. The app's functionality seemed promising at first, but I encountered significant issues. My funds were unexpectedly locked up, and navigating through the resolution process proved to be challenging. One major concern was the excessive fees charged during transactions. These fees substantially ate into my investment returns, leaving me dissatisfied wit"
2024-02-17 13:53:20,"I love Coinbase for investing into crypto fees go down as you use it more which is nice right now, just a few performance related issues as I think th ui uses way more resources than it really should for an app meant for trading in a market where every second counts and also has a ton of trash code that needs to be cleaned up and optimized very badly which is why I gave 3*. Even on a brand new phone everything you try to do lags and it's really bad coding."
2024-03-04 23:22:51,Would be great if the app wouldn't go down just because of higher trading volume. Customer service takes 45 minutes to even respond via chat and there is no phone option. But easy to use and the advanced trading function is a nice feature.
2024-02-20 14:45:19,"Like others mentioned the app has had a ""bug"" preventing you from seeing your balance. Tried contacting their support several times but their BOT generated responses are useless. I normally don't bother rating things but maybe if enough of us give the app this rating they'll take resolving the issue a bit more seriously! Happy to update this once the issue is fixed."
2024-03-11 10:02:05,Awful! Avoid! Trading crypto is risky but this app makes it painful too. Don't bother with the email support below it points you to a generic chat bot hung over faqs. The chatbot isn't great. The tests are more about locking you in than testing or growing knowledge. It's clunky adding payment methods with obscure error messages and screens that show incorrect balances most of the time. Closing accounts must have a zero balance or they take all the remaining funds.
2024-02-28 05:35:38,Love these clever digital genuises! Edit 2-2024 The app is hyper-sensitive with security now. I can barely navigate the app to complete a simple transaction of any kind. They will lock your account up so quick it'll make your head spin for 24 hours. It gives me a bonkers amount of anxiety to use it now. This is real money they control that I own. 🤔 That doesn't seem quite right to me anymore... I feel like I just got off a roller coaster All I did was exit the app
2024-03-11 23:05:02,"Have it since 2018, identity verified at the very beginning, picture of ID and selfie. Everything Good. Now I've been spending 3 days going through verification process again without knowing why they are asking it again. Each time verification ends with an email from them saying everything ok, go on line and here again that restrictions and another request to verify my identity. Loophole.Their help team only able to send me link for ID verification, no one taking seriously my claim"
2024-03-02 05:01:51,"This app is so confusing, I can log on through the web but when I try to log on in the app, it takes me to the Internet to login then sends me back to the app login. I've deleted the app and reinstalled and same thing keeps happening. I used to never have this issue, but since it's started I just can't get logged in through the app."
2024-03-30 03:16:53,"Coinbase app excels in providing a seamless and secure cryptocurrency trading experience. With its intuitive interface, robust security measures, extensive cryptocurrency offerings, and seamless integration, it's a top choice. Customer support is helpful, but fees should be considered. Highly recommended for all levels of traders."
2024-03-12 03:36:51,"I've been waiting for my identity verification too long! It's been a week since I haven't been able to access my funds. This is unacceptable, not even paypal does this! Worst to have it, when I've tried to contact support it has been impossible! Every time they show a message of allegedly too much traffic than ""usual"" and eventually they close the chat!! There is no email information where to send a complaint! Worst customer service than even Wells Fargo."
2024-02-26 19:32:11,"They keep forcing new features into it at the cost of reliability and bugs. I've been having more and more issues that have needed reaching out to their support team. It's also really slow compared to other financial apps, particularly with their visualizations."
2024-04-09 15:43:43,"Stupid sign-in button has an error, you can't get into the sign-in page. And this error isn't new either. Several reinstalls, cache-clearings and software updates later, still broken. Fix the damn app."
2024-03-05 13:00:30,"Very simple and easy to use. 2 stars removed for a very scary situation. After a recent update it appears to have turned off biometrics and I had to manually enable it. Now I assume trading would have needed a password and two factor, but the fact that I was able to open my app and. See balances alone is a concern."
2024-04-13 17:23:49,"I leave 3 from 5, if you dont pay closer attention the market will say completely different prices than what your about to buy for, no 2 pages have the same numbers when dual screening coinbase one and advanced spot, if doge is at .169 on spot, advanced will show .17 and when you preview it will show an even higher price of .176, it also doesn't tell you the exact amounts either, the spread absolutely needs to go on the total purchase ... .005 cent can be a lot sometimes"
2024-03-18 21:17:55,"They illegally optained my paypal that's linked to a completely different email address, then charged me $60. When I called to see what happened, they told me that they searched my coinbase email that's how they linked both my emails together. They proceeded to cancel everything and refund me, but instead of sending the money back to the account, they put the money on my coinbase account. Now I have to use the app and already lost $10 trying to transfer the money."
2024-04-01 06:34:40,"Edit -- New Review -- I have tried every exchange and wallet that I could find that are legal in my location. Coinbase is by far the easiest interface, least click happy, and most efficient as far as time or money (from a CB One pov). Easily melds with CB Wallet for sending back and forth as needed. Love the condensed info yet uncluttered look."
2024-03-26 14:31:28,"I used to really love this app before I got married and got my name changed. Now I can't verify my new identity without changing the name on my profile which I'm not allowed without verifying my ID and I don't have an ID with my maiden name on it. Tried contacting them via phone number and they keep transferring me to the app chat which does not help because I'm communicating with a bot, IM SPUN IN CIRCLESS! So now I just have money sitting in there and I want to trade but can't!"
2024-03-18 21:12:20,App is terrible for trading. Orders are very difficult to manage. They don't even show the limit price on the orders page anymore and they dont list filled orders in respect to when they were filled but rather date it was placed so it can get really confusing keeping track of buying and selling.
2024-03-18 15:12:01,"Very user friendly app, super easy to set up and move money around. However, the fees are too much. You need to pay fees for every transaction. Even when withdrawing. If you are Canadian better off using Wealthsimple."
2024-04-01 10:58:17,"The app is unable to login, I have this problem for more then 3 months, with all the updates since! When you click the Sign In button, it says: ""Something went wrong. There was a problem while launching sign in. Please try again."""
2024-03-21 20:14:16,"I can't sign in, I got the error 'there was a problem while launching Sign In', tried all the troubleshooting I find, reinstall app, clear cache and storage data, connected via mobile network, app is updated to latest version, android is up to date, the only way I manage to login was to use a VPN app and change my location to Germany. I can connect without any problem from mobile browser so I assume the error is not related to location."
2024-03-23 14:49:47,"I have been using coinbase since 2012 and haven't had problems near what they have been recently. I have things that are currently still stuck in staking, my daily charts are all just flat lines for some reason, when you try to sell or move funds when it's busy you get errors and I have been charged noticably higher prices than the coins I purchased even got close to in hours. I have completely stopped recommending coinbase to other people and will probably start looking at dex's myself soon."
2024-03-28 14:27:57,My account has been working well recently. Trading and buying is easy. I had a problem accessing my account in the past when a factory reset was performed on my phone and I could not reach customer support. So I always fear changing phones or going to factory settings.
2024-03-29 22:37:27,"Great centralized exchange. Pleasant user interface, learn and earn programs. Ultimately though, if you want to own your own cryptocurrency you need to get a physical wallet like ledger. Coinbase and centralized exchanges are great for beginners though"
2024-04-01 11:06:51,"I haven't been able to sign up or either sign in for a whole week now since I downloaded the app, unless I use VPN, and even after that's, when I am almost done signing up, it will tell me to switch off my VPN or connect to Wi-Fi, I simply don't know the issue with coinbase app.... Please the link you sent me in invalid"
2024-03-25 21:21:58,"Very poor or non existent support. My account has been locked for months. Support just passes you onto an email address which is never acknowledged and never responded. Expect you crypto to randomly get locked and no way to get it unlocked. Essentially you have no way to sell what you have in your account so when you want to sell, you can't. It used to be good, I wouldn't recommend coinbase anymore. While I expect some level of security around crypto accounts, it's not worth using coinbase."
2024-03-24 15:48:51,"Impossible to contact support. They are total scam. They approved the identity then let me trade then block. They just keep money and not answering. Nobody should use their services. Update: I waited more than 2 hours to talk your ""live"" support and 7 days for email. You are not even funny. Still no answer. The issue is you can't contact their support and their answer is contact support :))"
2024-03-31 18:11:00,Fees are way too steep. Even the monthly plan cost too much. And the spot prices feel off to me. I saw one never using the basic plan and that number changed when I switched over to the Coinbase Pro option while doing that free trial.
2024-04-02 16:38:20,The customer service is atrocious. It is impossible to get someone on the phone to talk to. Their automated robot hangs up on you after you select that you need to speak to someone regardless of the option you select. I just closed my account and highly recommend using a different service.
2024-04-01 10:11:02,"coinbase advanced does not work at all. I have both an iPhone and galaxy s24 I have attempted to trade on the coinbase app and it is one of the worst apps to try to trade on. if you click to buy or sell the screen will just buffer never to load, pick any crypto to try and trade and it will do this. ontop of that the app will crash and be unbearable to use with how slow there servers are."
2024-03-26 07:59:39,"The app doesn't work well, my transfers from Coinbase to Coinbase wallet don't go through half the time, which is why I have a long delay when purchasing cryptocurrency. Also, my crypt disappeared when I was making a bridge, and no one has helped me with this, support has not responded. One plus of this application is the ability to buy some cryptocurrencies that are not available in other places. However, the service itself works poor and is one of the most inconvenient crypto exchangers."
2024-03-24 17:05:33,"The worst platform ever! No adequate support, two months (!!!) of attempts to activate an account with endless document submissions, and blurred copy-paste responses from them. I have successfully created accounts with over 10 other crypto exchanges within 1-2 days without encountering any obstacles. Avoid Coinbase at all costs!"
2024-04-02 11:00:08,"After you confirm your address by some miracle you are met with add a payment method. Now you have 3 payments methods debit card, PayPal, via bank transfer. So debit card literally says make sure its debit card mine is matter of fact 2 of them are when I add them error. Down to 2 payments. PayPal will only let you withdraw so why add a payment method ? No sense. Via bank transfer, transfered it literally 2 days ago still not answer. It is just so painful to open coinbase account its not worth."
2024-03-29 12:58:54,"Once you are set up. This has been one of the easiest platforms to purchase my crypto. A few clicks and it is done. And in my experience, I have been able to transfer to a wallet immediately. It has been great for my NFT purchases."
2024-03-26 09:27:10,"Coinbase is extremely easy to use, exceptionally easy to use for beginners and modest trading. The fees are very competitive but they give you the option of only $30 a month to have unlimited trades with no fees which by far is a exceptional deal. They also have a trading platform for experienced and pro traders."
2024-04-04 11:21:48,"Editing my review, as it seems that 1. The international support is available on Twitter (found it myself) 2. There is a community support option, which I couldnt find, only received the link, after leaving a 1 star review here But I really hope that you make these support options more explicit, because as international customer all I have access to, from the help/contact page is a) phone numbers, which aren't receiving my calls, and b) a chatbot, which prohibits me contacting support agents."
2024-04-03 13:54:35,"Does not allow me to put my Australian ID, passport in total fraud company. Gives you chance to invest the outright prevents you updating your information and progressing the account. Sometimes check endlessly searches or does nothing but the ID and information is accurate. Smells like fraud, previous reviews in 2022 had similar issues."
2024-03-19 18:38:52,"I like Coinbase, but it can be slow during peak times. More annoyingly, there have been dropouts and failures, when I've needed to execute well-timed buys or sales. Unforgivable for a platform dealing with capital at this level."
2024-03-26 17:28:56,"Application is buggy. Customer support is just being juggled from one department to another. Edit:From 2 stars to 1. their response is what I'm talking about. The reply telling me to dig through pages of coinbase for dummies came faster than a reply (still waiting) to my help desk ticket to allow me to fix the known bugs I was informed of by cust support via phone call to actually use my account. These bugs require action on their end, and nothing on my end can move me forward at this time."
2024-03-19 18:18:58,Love how your app crashes and signs people out of the app every time theres a major market move. Real convenient for you I guess. Oh and im required to do 2FA even tho no ones trying to steal my money and ive lost my phone multiple times so i just put someone elses number on my account cuz you wont let me disable it. Real convenient and secure.
2024-03-21 00:18:16,Everytime I try to close my account it keeps looping to a previous page. I've never in my life had this much trouble with an app and it's driving me crazy. Can't get ahold of any kind of support and i'm honestly at my limit with this thing
2024-03-24 10:42:39,"Inconsistent to say the least, always has the availability to buy more and deposit. However when it's time to withdraw, the option isn't always available, more often then not, my linked PayPal doesn't appear for me to withdraw too. Very concerning"
2024-04-03 02:10:27,"EXTREMELY difficult to use, verging on impossible. Will not let me use my bank acct., will not let me use PayPal, and keeps asking for my debit card info over and over and over. Been trying for three days and it still won't let make a purchase. No way to talk to anyone. No way to get help. I suspect Coinbase is scam of some sort, just after bank acct info. Perhaps the algorithm only allows the wealthy to use it."
2024-03-30 00:59:53,Overall I think it's an awesome site it has its ups and its Downs it's a little confusing but once you get the hang of it it's easy and also the transaction fees weren't too bad. Definitely would recommend
2024-03-19 13:11:34,What a joke. They somehow put my refunded crypto into web 3 locked out of it to verify. I verified and they kept on keeping me locked out they were hoping to scam me but one the better business bureau gets involved they will have no choice. Even the agents tell you are verified and we don't know why you can't access it. It's a scam and don't use it. Thanks for the support link but I have contacted the support team over a week. It's 48 hours after completion of verification not 1 week illegal!
2024-03-18 15:16:36,"You can't change your phone number if you have a new number to login or send crypto. Fees are extortionate on the app aswell for buying and selling crypto. I'd suggest using other platforms. There staking rewards are worse too. The app needs work. Your support doesn't work and I have to reset my number two times for it still not to update on the app, for a market cap the size of coinbase your app is totally useless. I can gaurantee im not adding anything crypto related to this app again"
2024-03-20 20:42:01,"With the latest update it is now necessary to switch to Coinbase Advance to see the spot prices and my watchlist, but then why can't I see my portfolio and the h/d/w/M/Y trend graph like I can I the non-avance Coinbase? Makes no sense from a user point of view. These changes accomplish nothing except a low rating and an annoyed user. Be better Coinbase!"
2024-03-24 13:30:50,"As long as trading volume is avaerage the app works although i know some people who have been locked out of their accounts for losing or getting a new phone. If volume spikes you're screwed here. Support (outsourced to India) will lie constantly, telling you internal issues are ""global"" issues. Find another platform, it's hard to be worse at this. I currently have LTC on CB that is paid for and cannot be exported, no explanation for why."
2024-03-21 00:02:31,Horrible app and customerservice. Copied and pasted the address and it sent it somewhere else. They admitted they had issues with copy and paste. Unfortunately I can't put screen shots in my review
2024-04-09 06:04:39,"I appreciate Coinbase's user-friendly interface and wide range of supported cryptocurrencies, making it easy for me to navigate and trade various digital assets. Additionally, their strong security measures and reputation for reliability give me peace of mind when using their platform for transactions. Good job Brian Armstrong and your staff!"
2024-03-24 19:33:13,"Suddenly the login has stopped working, after working for years. Can login on the web, but not through the app - even tried uninstall and reinstall to no avail. The app is therefore pretty useless."
2024-04-16 01:14:37,"my transfer from coinbase wallet stuck at 'pending' for more than 24 hours noe, even though it has marked successful in block explorer Update: 36hour in, now it asked for sender detail, but the field for this is missing. Tried the link given, not working"
2024-03-07 01:23:58,"I put 1 star until I know what's going on with my ID verification. I submitted 3 times already. Twice with mobile phone, once with laptop. All rejected with same reason: ""we couldn't verify your ID card + photo"". I ensure texts on my ID card are readable before submitted. Tried live chat, no human, asked me to wait 1hr for human assistance. It's been more than 24hr since I registered, no transaction is allowed until ID has been verified. edit: community-support can't be used. Button unresponsive"
2024-03-29 10:37:34,"I've been using this app for many years now and I never had any trouble cashing out until now, I tried uninstalling it and downloaded it again, but now it won't even let me log in. I go through the verification steps, then it sends me back to the starting page."
2024-03-06 00:27:16,Can't sign in and I find the timing to be quite a coincidence Update - can't stand seeing my hard earned money just melt away so uninstalling. I'll never invest in any of these gimmicks again be careful and be ready to lose it all if you decide to. This app is easy to use and hasn't hampered me from any activity (unlike robinhood which is a big scam or Celsius that just straight up robbed people). Good luck!
2024-01-18 16:23:41,"Can't even verify my identity. The app stops when selecting the option to take photos of id. Constantly asking to sign in, which requires a 2FA text message. Can't contact support through the app because after I verify my account through 2FA, it just drops back to a previous page, and it's just an endless loop. I don't want to call support, I just want the app to work. Uninstalled, reinstalled. Restarted phone. Garbage app."
2024-02-28 05:17:31,"My account has been disabled for over 2 years now because I haven't clicked on the link they sent for verification purposes. Those ""verification"" emails literally looked like spam every time one was sent. Still battling through ""customer service"" to get account unlocked."
2024-03-23 04:03:33,"The app stopped working on my phone since January 2024. It never opens since then. I have updated the up several times, cleared cache of the app and even Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still not opening. What could be the problem? Please help me out"
2024-02-27 03:43:04,"Even though I pay $30 a month to NOT get fee'd to death, it eventually runs out & u start getting taxed like a regular Joe & that ain't right, it's still more compatible than most e-wallets & easier to send and receive so all in all, I like it. Just these fees & Slippage rates take a lot of $$ from ya. Nature of the beast I guess 🤷🏽‍♂️"
2024-02-02 03:55:06,"Says when you purchase crypto you get to spin a wheel to get up to $200 in bitcoin but none of my transactions are finishing the 4th step of ""buy crypto."" Edit: went to the support link and it won't even let me submit the request because the wait times are longer than normal. How tf is a support ticket not eble to go throw its not like its a live chat or phone call. Coinbase has the worst customer support of any app."
2024-03-20 16:32:56,"Avoid this scam app. It will put restrictions and not inform you. Support is non existent (no email, 1hr waits, poor virtual chat bot). My first crypto purchase via card included a 'spread' which actually meant a ridiculous 5% fee. Then I couldnt deposit via bank transfer to use Advanced or even withdraw! Support were unwilling to provide an explanation for the restrictions that were not communicated. But they had no problem pocketing the ridiculous 5%fee. Scam app, poor customer service. Avoid"
2024-02-26 17:54:12,"Just do not put your money on it! They asked me to verify my account again after 3 years of use! I have tried almost 15 times to do the process, my documents are right and nothing is wrong with them but i had never took a response! I can't cash out or send my cryptos and the support system its just a bot tgat says the same exactly thing!I have tried to contact the support with plenty of emails but still! so i have lost all my money!"
2024-01-31 11:12:30,"Seem to be great so far! No major issues, as long as you familiarize yourself with the fine print, holds, fees, ect.. They also offer great rates & rewards! Side note: It may be useful for you to get Coinbase One if you buy, swap, trade or sell it will save you that fee Everytime! That's all for now..."
2024-03-05 16:10:04,"The app freezes all the time. Every day now I have to sign in because my device isn't recognized.and they want to charge $30 a month for pro for what, it to freeze in the middle of a buy or sale no. After ever buy or sale I have to leave the screen I'm on then go back. Do you think that cryptos price is going to wait for me to switch back no crypto waits for no one."
2024-03-18 12:30:22,"Utterly shambolic and frustrating, almost infuriating. Account balances showed zero lately. ID verification fails again and again despite uploading various clear and high definition photos of an ID card, passport and a driving license. No explanation provided. Reaching out to a human is like pulling teeth with three hour long wait times over the telephone. Accepted an offer for a callback that never came."
2024-01-29 21:15:47,"Will give the app 5 stars but all charts snd trading pairs will not populate. For several days now a message pops up saying: "" something went wrong an error has occurred while producing this chart"" Can't read any analysis. Not good. Desktop version works fine. Mobile app does not work. Please provide an update to fix this bug🙏"
2024-02-09 06:09:06,"so far so good...okay... so this is now a few years into using coin base. I enjoy this exchange. It's ease of use is great. Fees are higher for this luxury. They also make tax time great with an easy summary as well as the files needed for break down. Certain coins like kaspa would be nice, that said, good coin listing overall. Invest at your own risk. This is one of the biggest and cross my fingers, safest. Happy hodling!"
2024-03-14 11:24:41,"A piss poor excuse for an app. I got signed out and can't get signed back in. I've requested a password reset, but the links in the instructions don't work! There's no phone number that I can find to contact them. I think it's a scam. They contacted me with a link to get things straightened out, but it took me back to the same pages that didn't work before."
2024-02-29 22:02:09,"The app does not let me Sign In to my account. I get the ""Something went wrong"". ""There was a problem while launching Sign In. Please try again later."" I wiped all cache + data, updated to newest version. Same problem. I bought a new Samsung S23 Ultra and tried from the new phone. Same problem. I can still use the website on my laptop. But the app no work. The support team solution? ""We don't know why it does that, but you can still sign in on your phone using a browser"" Great 👏"
2024-01-31 10:56:33,"I purchased crypto using my bank account. When I tried to do a transfer to another platform, I got an ""account restricted"" notice. When I contacted them they told me I couldn't do transactions for 90 days. Of course they didn't give a reason, just ""for security"". I was told if I wanted my money I had to change it to cash and return it to my bank. They got 2 transaction fees and I got nothing for my money. If I could give them 0 stars I would. My review stands. Support didn't reply to my email."
2024-03-01 13:22:47,The app is slow and unresponsive. It crashes when Bitcoin runs also. So you won't be able to sell when it's time. Had to update review again. The app seriously is the slowest and worst during the most stressful times. I cannot believe a multi-million dollar company can't do better. Their reply is laughable. Trouble shooting? It was my fault your platform went down the other day when Bitcoin was surging? Wow! The nerve!
2024-01-28 15:56:53,"was working fine then all of a sudden Advanced Charts wont show, ""sorry we had trouble creating this chart"" on ALL my devices (samsung phones)..... extremely frustrating! already contacted support who told me they were aware of it and that coinbase status site would reflect this..... and of course coinbase status site has NO mentions of this error thanks coinbase!"
2024-02-17 08:28:28,"I can't seem to be able to sell via the app or the wallet as I don't get the option to sell. I tried to follow the instructions video but it doesn't show me the same thing that my app does. Also on my ""notifications"" screen, I have a picture with a message saying ""something doesn't look right"". please can you help. thank you."
2024-03-05 14:16:13,"Worked fine until it didn't. Coinbase frequently goes down when theres a lot of market activity. Every time bitcoin makes a big move it goes down. This morning the app just stopped working altogether. I'm able to sign in on a web browser but the app simply won't open. If Binance.us was still able to make transaction with banks, I would be back on that exchange in a heartbeat."
2024-02-13 05:40:45,"The app is well designed. Detailed charts are easy to read. Trading is simple. I couldn't reach Customer service through the app, though. Could be problematic when signing up or if a trade fails and your funds are locked in a pending transaction. Coinbase is still the BEST exchange open to the USA in terms of liquidity and active traders."
2024-02-12 23:42:47,"XXX AVOID XXX All of my assets were locked behind some error that only support could solve, but their support is nearly non-existent. The only option for help is to sit and wait for an agent to connect on a ""live-chat"", but you may wait 5, 15, 30, 60 minutes and never connect. There's no indication of how long you have to wait or where you are in line, you just wait indefinitely. Over a week I've only managed to connect 3 times with an agent and they've been entirely unable to solve amything."
2024-03-16 01:19:20,"Horrible company. Absolutely no customer support. If you call the support number it's just a robot saying that they are too busy and to try later. No option for a callback, a long wait on hold, nothing. I have been trying later for almost two weeks now. The issue? I cannot link my bank account. Why? It's a joint bank account with my wife, both of our name are on account. So a problem that is 100% a result of their clunky, awful, and tedious signup process. I'll take my business elsewhere."
2024-03-14 16:36:02,"The worst document verification ever. So in order to use this app you have to upload documents to verify identity and address. I have spent 3 days trying to verify my address and the system fails every time rending the app absolutely useless. Inhave tried photos and pdfs both fail. I have tried property tax docs, insurance docs bank docs mortgage docs, credit union docs revolut statements. All have fail because of your foolish terrible app. I will be going elsewhere now."
2024-03-17 19:47:30,"this account I'm using has been disabled by them probably due to not logging in for areounf a year or 2, tried to reach them and it's really hard since everytime I try I still need to send a verification code AND wait from their end to authenticate the code I sent. I'm giving this another chance since this is the only wallet to support bling games transaction"
2024-03-11 15:57:39,"30 days ago, my account was locked or suspended for no reason. I have less than 10k on the account, and I add a few hundred each month, sometimes more. For the last 30 days, I haven't been allowed to make any purchases or sell anything or convert. I get a message that my account is under review. When I go to customer support, they won't tell me why. I have uploaded my personal information and ID a second time..then support hangs up with no support/ case #. After an hour long wait."
2024-03-10 00:14:27,"This app sucks, wouldn't even open. Keeps on saying there's network issue, even tried using web service and all I could do is reach the help section. Anytime I try to sign in, it brings up the network issue again PS: don't tell me I'm having network issues cause if I did, I wouldn't be able to give this review"
2024-02-16 17:13:33,"I have memory issues and passwords are one of them. When I try to use the one I can remember they wouldn't except it. Now, i don't have the same phone number and the problems just keep escalating to the point that I've given up trying to get my property. It's just jumping from one hoop to the next and got no where. I even sent copies of my id and a selfie and here I am 3 or 4 years later and nothing still. This coin base has a great scam because once you forget your crypto is theirs. Scammers"
2024-03-14 18:06:09,"Horrible id verified system. It's completely broken! I took a Pic of my drivers license 3 times with s24 ultra, and it keeps asking me to do it again. Full license in view perfect photo. It did this to me 3 years ago as well. Closed my account, since I feel coinbase can not be trusted with such a simple task. How disappointing. Do better coinbase!"
2024-03-03 23:25:47,"App seems broken. I go to sign in, it takes me through a web flow and when I complete it it takes me back to the app but I'm still not signed in. I tried logging in in a browser but it says to open the app to receive a 2FA code. So there's literally no way for me to get into coinbase. Thank god I don't have anything stored there."
2024-03-05 21:05:08,"transaction issues during peak market fluctuations. errors displaying balances, random server issues when cashing out large sums which get hit with large transaction fees. to top it off I had my account hacked. thankfully I was able to recover it. I do not trust this service."
2024-02-03 04:02:19,"I seriously love Coinbase! It's easy to use, fast, secure, and best of all, wants people to learn and understand what the backbone of certain cryptocurrency is and how it can usually benefit everyone, not just specific groups of people. It's really hard to put into words, but give it a try, and it'll speak for itself. Thanks, Coinbase!!"
2024-02-17 15:30:44,"The app has serious bugs that make trading impossible. Issues include infinite loading screens and market pairs not displaying on the spot page. Clearing the cache is a temporary fix, but it's frustrating to do this repeatedly. Please address these bugs."
2024-03-08 20:10:41,I cannot login using a mobile device. However I can login using a desktop with the same credentials. What am I doing wrong? Error: Invalid email or password. Try clicking 'Forgot Password' if you're having trouble signing in. EDIT: I have no problem using this app on a newer android mobile device. App is quite good and easy to use.
2024-02-09 21:00:32,"I idenfied the issue, my biometrics wasn't recognized because the phone case was too thick, I removed it to place my finger. And, it worked! In case others have the same issue, just remove the case. "" just letting coinbase know that the coinbase app doesn't work (if the phone case is too thick), after an (un)successful login it defaults back to the login page. So, I cannot use the app to buy or sell anything."" :)"
2024-02-20 22:07:18,90% of this app is trash especially the new setup. The only reason I still have the app is because it's where I started trading and don't want to transfer funds. I have since browsed most and used some other apps and I would recommend literally anything else. Even the news feed which was the only reason I would continue to log in is completely ruined via the latest patch. Sad to see something you have hopes for go from terrible to pathetic
2024-03-07 14:12:25,"EDIT: I was never given a case number. I was told to verify my identity even though I have many times before and before I could even do it the rep disconnected from helping me. END EDIT. Wow customer service seemed to disappear. Been 4 days and still not even connected to a person. They just lie to you and then close the chat. Love that these people know my address, ssn, bank account and routing."
2024-02-27 10:36:30,"I've seemlessly changed to my new email for nearly every single account I've ever registered with absolutely no issues. Coinbase, however, won't let me update my email. Instead, I get a message telling me the update failed and to try again in 24 hours. No other option but to wait for 24 hours only to get the exact same message."
2024-02-03 04:14:40,"Coinbase has been good more often than bad. They make mistakes (my unstaking stuck, went more than double the unstaking period, etc.) but they made good on it by giving me $10. It's a huge company but I do have the sense that they are responsive; it may just take a while. Great public advocacy for crypto and way to go with the ETF - whatever roll you're playing."
2024-03-03 20:44:46,"I've been using coinbase for a few years now and it makes buying and selling crypto an easy experience. Not to mention they allow you to monitor the top movers in the market, as well as offer educational courses on crypto coins that reward you with FREE crypto tokens after you take a quiz just for learning about how new coins were made and how they operate. Coinbase also has a great customer service system that resolved the minor issue I had. Best in the biz."
2024-02-11 03:31:49,"The app is glitchy. There's no way to provide direct feedback for these errors. Coinbase can not truly provide an exceptional user experience this way. It is impossible. They just gouge. The fees are ridiculous and illogical, but simply because they can. There's no logical spread or clarity. The help center only offers help articles and a very simple chatbot that has few resources and limited understanding of the human language. I recommend Robinhood or KuCoin."
2024-01-30 19:23:07,This is a headache. I've transferred bit coin and cannot find any of it. I've contacted customer service on the app. They give me the flipping runaround. Not everyone is a master at it. I have money floating around and no one can help or can explain in simple terms.
2024-02-17 17:37:44,"Love the features of the debit card. App is buggy. APIs are buggy. Changing ramping limits is a huge negative. Usdc 5.1% interest is great, but I don't trust the app enough to keep large amounts of usdc on the app. Makes me sad. I use Coinbase as a backup not my primary exchange."
2024-03-12 21:42:52,"I'm very weary to use coinbase for anything of importance. It seems every time there is a big move on btc the site goes blank not allowing any trading to occur. I wish it was a new occurrence but it seems this has been going on for years. They hide behind ""your funds are safe"" however you loose the ability to buy or sell during a big liquidity run and you might as well not have even joined in the first place. I'm guessing there is something going on behind the scenes that probably shouldn't be."
2024-03-12 17:05:38,"Ignore the robo reply saying to contact tech support because they are as useless as this app. This program is simply trash. Can't update, can't show your balance, can't trade, can't convert, can't transfer money, etc. If ""increased traffic"" is the cause of all this (as this is their go-to excuse) then it just shows how incompetent this company is with their network infrastructure and backbone. Please take my (and several others) advice and use another exchange and another app."
2024-02-29 00:59:21,Very confusing set up simple things like assets managing transfers are very confusing. Good luck getting in touch with costumer service. Don't forget all the trading fees it's 2024. Would be good app if better set up no fees and costumer service improvement.
2024-02-19 02:05:19,I have been trying to withdraw money from my vault 4 different times and had to wait 48 hours each time! Only to get an email saying the funds were automatically canceled because I didn't approve it! I did approve it as soon as I withdrew the funds from the vault! I talked to chat and sent in proof of me approving it but nothing has happened yet! You can't contact them through their support email. I want my damn money and I want it now! Having to wait 48 hours is absolutely ridiculous!
2024-03-16 13:24:22,After spending lots of time linking every payment method it says my limit is $5. Such a scan wallet I've now been hit with endless loading forced to restart the app over and over and it's still not working. Fix mobile. Increase payment limit Also I purchased crypto 4 times before my account was finished. Another part of your scam
2024-02-28 16:15:57,"Horrible app. If you're used to quick transactions, this app isn't the one for you. Bitcoin purchase from cash took one week to clear. Started a btc transfer, and it said 30 minutes, then said 2 days and asked me to ID verify. I verified my ID 5 times because nothing happened. Still didn't change from 2 days to transfer. Lost money because of this. I'm not against security, but clearly, it's my account. Traditional banking isn't even this bad. Asked chat bot to speak to agent. Chat bot closed."
2024-03-14 14:11:16,"Initially liked the app, but I've now seen performance issues. Market orders conveniently unfulfilled, and the app will suddenly slow down when trying to close orders so you can reposition. Very suspicious behavior."
2024-03-08 14:13:52,"Latest update removes ability to see what limit order bid dollar amount is in advanced mode under orders, shows sell or buy but not bid limit amount. Must click on each bid to see what dollar amount limit order bid was placed for, then entire page reloads. If you have hundreds of buy & sell limit orders like me, this app is now unusable to do serious trading with limit orders. Trying to undo the current update so can manage my hundreds of limit orders without having to click on each one. Why!!!!"
2024-03-17 22:28:43,Up until about 2 months ago the Coinbase app was both simple and quick to use; but now each page take forever to load. By the time you actually get the opportunity to purchase then the transaction times out because it's taking too long to process. Eventually it makes you give up and purchase it somewhere else. 3.17.24 update I haven't been able to log in for months now because the app no longer recognizes that I have a web browser 😡. I've been using duckduckgo for years so what's the problem?
2024-03-07 13:14:30,"Update2 06Mar24: waited over 1.5 hours to talk to support over the app not allowing me to purchase crypto. After performing all the troubleshooting steps (which I did previous to contacting) and nothing still working, I get told it's a bug and he abruptly ended the chat with no further guidance or assistance. There is almost NO support for the trouble you have so good luck if you need help"
2024-02-06 17:13:08,"Two days ago, the app came up and asked me to login and validate my info, all by itself. I did. Next day received notification that my coins are being sold, one at the time. I did not do it. Contacted customer service, asked them for info, no info. They checked, all good. Money was in acct. They locked it. I have lost 60% of my account. Still don't know why ?? Does anybody have any idea ?"
2024-02-28 18:28:32,"App can be a little unstable. I had all of my assets and account balance disappear, and the live support button in the app didn't work to bring up the chat. Issue resolved overtime, but this could have been bad if I were in the middle of some sketchy trades. I will update this overtime as I have more experience with the app. For pros, the UI is very good. I love being able to trade crypto for crypto and coinbase gives you market cap and other info that others do not provide for crypto."
2024-02-04 23:05:03,"Bit of a con. I wanted to cash out £450. When I sold, it defaulted to a euro wallet, which wouldn't let me cash out to a UK card, and the suggestion was to buy coin with euros, then sell that for GBP, then cash out. Each of these transactions has a £6.99 transaction fee, so it cost me £21 to get out my £450 (sorry, £430)"
2024-03-03 15:58:55,"Needs improvement. The fees are not justifiable for the number of times I've had pending transactions when trying to move into a wallet. Would be better if transactions went through quicker, seems to be 25% of my wallet transfer take longer then they should"
2024-02-16 18:17:23,Please stop changing the look every freaking day it seems. Just as get used to it you change it. Now only shows total coins on home page and not the oberall gain or loss percentage that it showed a week ago. I am genuinely tired of this all togehter and olan to seek alterantives for crypto. 2/10/24 Woke up this morning and no averages etc appear on any of my investments. I am sick of this buggy program. Ok now I am now only able to see the overall performance of each of my holdings
2024-03-05 02:47:20,Frustrating customer service only email. Takes them take a while to respond and they give you very vague responses almost no help. I lost a lot of money my account was on hold about 10 days I couldnt sell or do anything kept showing zero when I tried to sell. takes a excessively long time time for any newly transferred funds to clear also good luck with emailing them if you need any help should have a phone number or at the very least text . Edit: 2024 app has improved since
2024-02-22 02:48:36,"Why did you take the drop down menu in the portfolio where I could easily see between balance, performance, returns, etc. Now I have to go back and forth throughout the app to see that information. And why my total returns are not showing up anymore. I only see a false and bogus ""total returns"". Who the hell is in charge of this app? Why are you destroying it? C'mon guys."
2024-02-12 13:23:35,"I downloaded the app trying to create an account, but I got a notification that my country is not supported. I have already accounts in some five or six similar platforms, and never had any shch problem. This app is excluding so many countries."
2024-02-09 06:47:34,"From the beginning this app was problematic, verification was problems it wouldn't accept my selfie, after a gross amount of time with the customer service finally got past that, then I had to learn the hard way it takes an entire week to transfer funds and now after a abundant amount of time with crypto department setting up my paypal for immediate transfer and using it, they tell me I didn't use paypal and I used my bank so I have to wait a week again even though I used paypal, unbelievable."
2024-02-29 07:30:31,"Can you instruct me to how to get rid of that investor warning on the app. Has been there for months? I've already read info and done the test. I tried to do it again from the app and link to the page, but I need to log in again on the site, but when I get the code from the authenticator the app closes and so cannot complete the log in and have to start process again. Is a mess."
2024-01-31 23:38:45,The platform is always failing in some way and locking up your account. They will also confirm a transfer of funds allow you to make purchases then days later tell you that the funds never came thru and you owe them money. It's just not worth the hassle.
2024-03-12 07:31:02,"great app. I've been using this application for some time now. the only downfall I noticed is that there is a transaction limit of 2000 a day for withdraws.. and you can only make up to 3 e transfers a day when I would like much more transfers than 3 a day. Once this is fixed, you will have a true 5 star from me."
2024-02-06 17:22:12,"Good app generally little niggles but nothing of a showstopper till 1-2 months ago when they added a FCA ""Don’t invest unless....."" Banner which even after reading all the links can't be got rid of. This takes up a fair bit of screen on a phone, so my like for this app has gone down. Other apps allow you to ok this banner to remove, letting them know you acknowledge the risks. Reply- I did contact your support and uploaded images. Was told that's they way it is and ended chat."
2024-03-16 11:27:19,"EDITED:Full of hidden fees. Takes money even when it says ""Free"" to transfer back to your bank. One of mine was £529 confirmed in the app, then the email said £518. Pretty disgusting tbf. So ... I stuck around ""three years later"" I love you coinbase 🥰 I stuck the bear market out, learned a lot and after the collapse of Tera, three arrows,FTX I've come to learn TRUST is something hard to find in this space. Well I trusted coinbase when I didn't trust many others. It has been solid and reliable."
2024-02-27 22:41:19,"It takes me close to 40 minutes to make a BTC advanced trade purchase. Like how is it possible for this app to take 10 minutes to register anything I tap. Buying and selling on regular cb is smooth and fast but overpriced and doesn't offer the same control as advanced trading. How is it possible for a company with billions of dollars who's only product is software, be so bad at this, being the first to market is only going to protect your market share for so long when you decide to ship out trsh"
2024-01-27 23:15:16,"Was good, not any more. They used to charge high prices for fees but now they've lost their minds. Tried to buy 10 bucks of ether for a reward and they offered 3.50 worth of ether for 10 bucks. Um, no, hard pass. Also their csrs are foreign based and don't have a clue what you are saying or what they are doing. Good day. Edit: thanks for the fast response just wish your Google review response was as fast as your foreign csr response... update they offer learn and earn rewards and don't pay out."
2024-02-01 03:40:07,"So rubbish app for trading, all headache. So many bugs in the app. It took 2 weeks to change my phone number in my account. It advices to be careful not to lose your money, but it takes so many fees for every transaction, I paid a lot for the coinbase fee. As a tech man, I am advising stay away from this app."
2024-02-15 10:21:13,"Sort your sign in process out. It is my personal right to have privacy and use a vpn. I should not have to disable that right (pause the vpn) just to sign in to your app. I didn't before so you have either introduced an annoying bug at a crucial point or, worse, done this intentionally. Users trust you with their money. You should not be subverting that trust with nefarious attempts to diminish user privacy."
2024-03-03 20:31:49,"I had an account here and I've been off for awhile. When I came back, tried to log in, there was no account anymore. Where is my account? I had investments in there. So I made another account with the same credentials like the previous one hoping maybe it would link or something but nope, NOTHING!! So I've lost all my investments?? I should have stuck to binance from day one. Not happy at all. Bring back my account!"
2024-03-08 19:02:51,"Coinbase has been nothing but problems, it's always something new. It started with them not putting conversions through this was very regular. Then I couldn't buy even though I did identity check. The lastest is they allow you to receive coins but you can't sell, convert, or trade them. Or get them out. Support is an absolute joke. Haha god forbid you get angry it will be all your fault. I recently tried to send out MXC yep you guessed it never got there gone FOREVER. Hope this helps."
2024-02-24 16:49:09,"Fun for the Novice Investor; quasi similar to NYSE. It's an option for diversifying one's portfolio. Keep in mind that Cryptocurrency is subject to volatile swings in the digital market, just as any investment can be. However, it's a fun way to inspire people to think about their money in a non-traditional sense. Rather than thinking about how much money one creates through labor, one can consider passive income to help supplement inflation and cost of living expenses. I like the [CB] App."
2024-01-28 07:20:57,It is imposible to verify all the information they ask. They are limited to documents in English. And it is also imposible to contact them directly (it's only posible to speak with a chat bot). When you think you got to the option to contact them directly they give you a link that will lead to FAQ or the chat bot again. All processes are awful.
2024-01-29 23:53:46,"graphs in advanced trading don't work after last update. sometimes after reopening the application, rates only for some pairs are showing and the rest is just loading infinitely. otherwise it's quite good."
2024-03-11 20:22:38,"UPDATE TO:BEWARE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. There site crashes and it shows a 0 balance on my account so I lock it.To unlock I call customer service. I have a large amount to where they have to upgrade to a support ""team"" to handle it but the DONT HAVE A PHONE NUMBER. UPDATE: THEY FIXED AND GOT BACK TO ME ON A SUNDAY. Big time thanks for that. They have a few hiccups but they are doing a really good job. Will stay with them and happy to do so. Thanks team for the help. I'm grateful to you"
2024-02-27 12:17:47,"It's crazy that even after 2 years I can't sign-in on Android. I'm currently using a Pixel 7 with the latest updates (OS and Coinbase app) and I'm still getting ""There was a problem while launching Sign in""...Even on a clean OS it does the same..."
2024-03-07 23:12:51,"Terrible customer service! No phone number to call. 2 hours wait to speak to live chat, and when the agent finally showed up, there was no effort to resolve the issue. The issue is a mistake from the coinbase team where they marked my bank as a checking rather than savings account. I contacted my bank first and then waited two hours to let the coinbase support know that this is the issue and how to solve it, only to find out they repeated the same mistake again, and sold my holdings wrongfully."
2024-02-06 19:09:07,"Definitely the main crypto app on the market. The app is solid and secure. I do not like coinbase wallet though. When purchasing crypto, coinbase is smooth and does a good enough job. The Wallet function is pretty pointless to me. Especially because it's separate from the main coinbase app. Sometimes you'll get scam airdrops and gifts that look like you got something but it's actually a Keylogger to get your info. Same with emails. Do not click links to coinbase emails unless you requested it"
2024-02-08 02:58:26,"This app has actually made me money, taught me new skills, and elevated my crypto investing game. I highly recommend this app for anyone interested in a fun new way to use your phone to learn something new and make some extra money. I have not had any problems in any area of this app. I redownload it to every new phone. It's without a doubt worth your time and attention."
2024-03-03 06:29:36,"Today, the app is not opening right and gets stuck on the blue screen with the logo in the middle. On both my tablet and phone, it does this. Not very happy about this... I check my account every day and this is the first time this has happened. Whatever update you did, just made it freeze up and not work right. Please fix his soon!"
2024-01-25 03:56:11,"Can't even get my driver's license to scan. I got 3 cameras on my phone. It shows a good pic in 1x zoom I click capture, then when it goes to show me, its my 2x zoom not 1x zoom and is blurry. Then has the audacity to say it's my phone. Fix the app so it works properly"
2024-02-08 20:50:09,Coinbase allowed someone to bypass my two factor authentication methods and add passkeys of USB and NFC which I do not have when I do not have either. It also gave me the option to use an IPhone when I do not have an IPhone and never have had one or signed in using one. Coinbase support refused to thoroughly help so I had to lock the account mid-chat. Horrible and unsafe business practices.
2024-02-06 22:51:29,I an having a really bad time... since last 7 days unable to purchase Bitcoin!!! My limits on my cards are over £1k and when I go to buy Bitcoin says try later there is a technical issue!!! This is very frustrating and poor service!!! Please resolve this issue ASAP... I have emailed your support team. I am expecting to this be resolved promptly!!!! Disappointed user!!!
2024-02-26 15:46:54,Great tutorials and very easy to use. I would recommend anyone to use Coinbase if they are just getting started investing in Crypto. It's fun and lucrative for all users. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Many cryptos fluctuate greatly. The time is NOW to get started!
2024-03-10 02:56:51,"I have always signed in on a computer. I installed the app and at the bottom it asked if I wanted to open in the app or continue in my browser. I was using the app, unless this is malicious. Poor programming, and it doesn't engender trust."
2024-02-01 10:46:49,"Theres always something wrong with the app. Just now I updated it because I couldnt log in and it forced me to create a passcode, verify my email and so on... Even after the update I cant log in and just have the coinbase logo when opening the app and its frozen like that. Its not the first time I have issues. Coinbase yes. Coinbase app no."
2024-03-15 16:23:02,Useless app. Cant log in. Verified everything many times over always end up going back to the log in screen. Whats the point of setting up a passkey if it never logs you in. End up just using website. Hood is way easier to use and quick.
2024-03-08 08:34:04,"The worse performing investment app out there. Nothing is truly live. You have to constantly hit refresh to see the price or your balance. Look at Webull or Robinhood and learn a thing or two about creating an App. also they hold your funds hostage after they've cleared. Every investment app allows you withdraw the money 2 days after the deposit or when it cleared. Here it has to be 9 to 11 days, you can't even use Coinbase debit card to use the cash."
2024-02-28 22:49:35,"Today's outage does not bode well for when you experience real trading loads. Please add infrastructure to account for what will be coming. Also, get rid of the popup that tells me how to change between coinbase and advanced EVERY SINGLE TIME I OPEN THE APP. Edit: Thanks for the useless response. I have lowered my review to reflect this update."
2024-03-12 06:46:59,Couldn't even finish the setup. Received texts from 4 different sources (3 area codes and 1 text code) when trying to set up 2-step verification. Seems highly suspect to say the least. Glad I didn't enter any sensitive/bank info but I'm still worried I'm getting scammed.. Trying to delete my unverified account but chat says wait time is at least 50 minutes..
2024-03-04 01:35:25,"Delayed my transactions after 3 successful transactions, even after using 2FA, added verification docs at least 10 times. Keeps saying verification will take 10 mins and then nothing. Lagging 0 customer support Unresponsive so many times Redundant info Keep routing to browser and back to app showing the same info"
2024-03-27 00:55:28,Overall good experience! From the reviews I've read I'm not sure how but I'm happy to pay to be a part of Coinbase One so I can buy/convert/sell with no fees(up to a certain cap for each month). And the app has came a long way from when it 1st released. Works great
2024-03-16 01:56:50,"This is ridiculous Signed out from the app,can't sign back in. I,m not in USA at the moment,dont have my USA phone on me,I'm in Europe 2 times I verified my account, they let me sign back through Google app I send e mail explaining everything to the support, on Google app I cant do much only check balances, if want to do something I have to verify through my phone(they send code)which I don't have it on me"
2024-01-27 17:29:25,"Paranoid security verifications has made user experience of this app a nightmare. I can't believe after moving thousands of dollars around CB for years. they are asking me for a utility bill pic to verify my account eventhough passport id is already verified..my utility bills are not in english deal with it, i am not going to translate and notarize them for your paranoid verification process. there are other platforms who have figured to make the experience way smoother."
2024-02-08 02:15:44,"I will start by saying, I really like the Coinbase, how it is user friendly, features it offeres, etc.. If I would leave a rating on that alone, it would be 4 to 4.5 stars. The reason I leaves 3 is that I had could not buy or transfer funds or any type of holdings for the last 6months. This started off with a ban because of questions of 3rd party usage or something.?? Ban just lifted after I had to answer more questions and explain how I didn't do anything wrong.. again. I got the runaround"
2024-01-31 21:48:18,one of the best app to use for cryptocurrency the only aspect that I would say that is not really fine tune will be the basic understanding for beginners most people don't understand it if you can make it a little bit more easier for beginners they jumping in let's go Columbus to the Moon
2024-03-05 11:02:38,"Problems with charts , they don't load . They didn't work at first for months then started working. 2 days ago 1\22\24 , quit working again. Update 3\5\24 everything is working normally the charts and site is great on mobile, even better on desktop."
2024-01-30 01:00:19,"WARNING the new update will not do advanced charting on Android Samsung s22 and s23 series phones. Have tried uninstalling, installing the app m. Also was on the phone with COINBASE support for over an hour. Otherwise the app was wonderful. Unable to trade on this app now. PLEASE FIX ASAP."
2024-02-16 01:10:40,"Update 2/15/24 - knocked off a star due to changes. -No longer defaults to Advanced Trade which is really annoying. -Not cool with the forced default screen, particularly it showing portfolio balance. Not looking to advertise."
2024-02-15 14:49:38,"This has been the worst experience ever. I did small transactions no problem, was going to buy a little more bitcoin and send it out. A day before i was able to send it my account was restricted couldnt do anything. Contact support told me dont know why its restricted looking into it no explanation at all. Its been 3 days and still no communication why my account is restricted still have money in my account cant get it out beware its been frustrating and a struggle. Will not use again"
2024-01-29 05:38:04,This app has suddenly turned into a clunky piece of junk. Kicks me out. Won't let me sign in with biometrics. Takes forever for page to load. Have to choose browser. Tried their fixes. Nothing worked.
2024-03-11 15:54:19,"Coinbase support team is doing their absolute best to be the least helpful as possible. ESPECIALLY, if it involve your money. Withdrawing on Paypal isn't possible but the option is there to scam you out some fees to sell and buy to resell back your crypto. 3x the fees for 1 transaction. Reaching out to the support team by phone takes 7 hours, chat takes 3 hours but you need to harass their support bot to talk to someone. Support on the Google store sends a non-working link. Do not trust them."
2024-02-18 16:27:56,This is an update: Coinbase keeps getting better and better. It's great for the novice to the experienced investor. There's many trading options and many opportunities to make interest on your crypto holdings...I've not seen that in other platforms that I use.
2024-03-07 00:13:09,Updated: solid app nowadays. App experience is extremely laggy. It's slow to startup and often needs to be restarted. Also UI is lacking relative to other modern app interfaces in the finance world.
2024-03-05 16:55:47,"Today, (5/3/24) CoinBase has gone down AGAIN and cost me profits AGAIN. You can't justify your fees with a service this bad! I'm literally not able to exchange on and exchange! I couldn't even exchange some coins for any currency! No wonder why investors have pulled out! You're better off using another exchange if I'm honest, especially with the last update being worse, along with these constant crashes and lack of respect towards users."
2024-03-11 18:36:31,"Can't use the edit order button. Don't use this company. Their wait times even on chat support are 2+ hours. Yet they insist on disconnecting you if you don't respond to ""are you there"" prompts every few minutes. It clear they don't want to provide any sort of support except for issues that involve making them look bad on public forums."
2024-01-27 13:34:16,"Since day one of using this app I have not been able to access my money and that started over six months ago. I have been given the runaround by their support staff, lied to and basically left hanging with no resolution to simple problem of their app not recognizing and accepting my ID. Still having on going battle with them and still don't have my money and now I'm having to contact lawyer to sue to get my money and close my account on the worst app I have ever used. Don't waste your time tryin"
2024-02-26 07:38:12,"Working now, thank you! ---- Old review: ---- It's now incompatible with my Pixel 7 Pro - a common and standard phone - so I can't get updates! I contacted Support but they can't (or just won't) contact the devs who could actually fix it."
2024-03-07 16:10:04,Things are getting better. Not going to lie. I see another update. I'm scared to push the button. I'm liking some of the things y'all corrected. When I do push that up date button. I'm praying that the team is still going forward in the right direction. But my confidence is still on the fence. 4 stars for the ap as it is. Fine job Coinbase team. Thank you for listening to the little guy...
2024-03-05 05:37:50,"This app does not allow me to sign in to my account from my phone. I have been unstalled and re-installed it including restart my phone a dozen times, but did not help at all. NOTE: i have no problem of signing in from my laptop."
2024-03-08 10:09:27,great app. so easy to use but what let's it down is the annoying massage at the top of the app that you can't get rid of and takes up almost a quarter of the screen.
2024-03-11 18:52:35,"Delays to respond to inquiries is outrageously high. The ID verification also does not make any sense. Good luck to understand if the verification is processing or just lost. Also, how am I supposed to know what you have said in a case if I don't have access to the response? 🤦‍♂️ ""Case closed"" is not enough to know."
2024-03-13 03:44:43,"Horrible customer service, over 1 year i can not use my account it is banned because of background check which is never finished. I wrote and get in touch with customer service they open a case and give me the case number which they did nothing and never respond the result. Think twice when you work with company. App is really easy and good to use but service is terrible..."
2024-03-16 22:14:52,"""Live chat"" is not actially live, fyi. Support is unreliable and not usually available when they are having issues. Many are calling in with problems which is why they are directing customers to chat but beware! Chat is a bot, not a live agent and does not appropriately address customer issues. I recommend having more than one platform or you will be hosed by Coinbase."
2024-02-14 18:49:28,"This app is horrible, they steal your money through their trading fees, I have lost a ton of money using the platform. They charge you for everything you do, over and over, and when you don't know how or what your doing and your getting started. It's eats all your money and you don't realize. I use wealthsimple and it is completely free to buy and sell crypto stocks and transfer money, and they trust my transactions up to 10 grand without question, these people hold your money on you and steal"
2024-01-28 06:25:54,"I was using the coinbase until this morning. Then, I couldn't access my account suddenly. I called the the coinbase support center and they can't help me since the email address is not on their system.. I don't quite understand this situation. I lost all that money because they can't locate my email on their system.. I used it all these years.. suddenly, it is not on the system .. sure"
2024-02-20 23:34:30,"SCAM. Don't let an exchange hold your keys Coinbase reversed my bitcoin purchase many days after it was made after a significant raise in the BTC price. It was the first time I had made a transaction after the app forced me to reconfigure with plaid and coinbase literally attempting to pull miney from the old account and the customer service was unable to help. I made purchases that are somehow locked in a defi wallet I have never used, I can't convert them or even figure out how to access them"
2024-03-09 00:20:12,"They charge you money for everything! Deposit money into the app CHARGE. Sell your stock CHARGE. I guess if you're into that then get this app. And before I get a ""sorry"" reply don't bother. You do you. Oh and when you go to cash out they say you only have like 5% of what it shows. Never putting my money into this app again. Luckily I tested the waters with just $20"
2024-02-28 19:04:17,"My balance disappeared on app and support is not answering the phone number and live support feature is down. WTFF!!!!!!!!!!??? Edit: I have had money in this app for 3 years and this event made me realize one thing, you don't even pay someone to answer the goddamn phone! I'm pulling my funds because people that can't even communicate to their customers do not deserve the money that I work so hard for."
2024-02-19 21:47:19,Forcing me to make a passkey rendering my account less secure and singing me out four times in a row and enter a code. I downloaded the app and it always goes to an external browser to sign-in. This is all just to accces the dedicated app. What is the point?
2024-02-20 21:00:35,"This app might need an update. I moved since I first signed up. I updated my address in settings but when I tried to order my Coinbase card it showed my old address in billing and shipping, and I only have the option of changing the billing address. Case# 1032180"
2024-03-06 04:31:29,I really like coinbase as far as the app goes but when there system goes down over cryptos common volitile pumps and dumps it makes this app completely useless. You have 1 job and thats to be able to buy and sell coins. What good is an exchange when they cant even handle a 10% price move from btc. I cant even imagine what opportunities are lost because they cant handle volume spikes. You are costing people money every time your system fails. This isnt the 1st ever bull run so please fix it
2024-02-24 01:53:45,"Support is nonexistent, neither available through the help center nor any other means. My issue has resolved itself, but the 'community support' link you mention in your reply isn't working; nothing happens when I click 'Submit'. This is unacceptable for a company that processes large amounts of customer funds."
2024-03-24 03:39:59,Definitely recommend. I'm very much a beginner and this app is a great way to start. Learn and earn category is great! You actually accumulate FREE crypto from learning! $0.99 transaction fee is the only downside.
2024-03-06 14:12:50,"""Do not contact our customer support as this could delay the process."" If you can't contact customer support for help, what else is there? If that isn't a huge red flag, I don't know what is. Don't bother contacting customer support through the link provided either, it just gives you a phone number with an ""estimated wait time of over four hours."" Horrendous customer service."
2024-03-17 02:55:41,"I'm sorry to hear that your app is slow, non-responsive, and unfriendly. It's just a tad frustrating when navigating to the right page feels like a marathon, and by the time I'm there, the trade's already sailed. But hey, we end users have so much time on our hands to engage your customer service, right? After all, time isn't money, according to Coinbase, who have loads of it. Cmon, guys, buck up man. Volume is picking up, and now is not the time to be parsimonious in the tech industry."
2024-04-10 01:52:12,"Anyone in Singapore please think carefully before using, my ID for verification was a llitte damaged and coinbase surprisingly accepted, after a year, when I was asked to verify for change of phone number the same ID I submitted over 20 times still cannot be verified. Worst is they keep sending the same reply over and over again."
2024-01-23 21:03:25,"All the new bells and whistles are useless if they don't work. Lots of new complexity but basic features like adding a debit card take deep breathing, about 4 hours and a lot of luck. I'm using a fully updated and brand new Pixel 7 Pro and tried hours of basic troubleshooting without luck. The app was quick and happy to take money from my bank, won't go the other direction and let me send funds back. Be careful!"
2024-03-22 16:53:38,"Horrible customer support. They make it very easy to put money in, but entirely impossible to take money out again, even after several, hours long, customer support conversations. Avoid this scam. Fittingly even the link provided in the response here doesn't work, keeping it impossible to get any support."
2024-02-14 01:04:24,I thought it was really low of you guys to make Coinbase act as a Browser to trick me into opening a link through it instead of my other browser. You used that dirty tactic to force me to buy into one of your services. I will never ever recommend you to anyone going forward. That's really shady moves for such a big company. You lost my trust.
2023-12-21 20:31:36,"Edit: Never mind. You can find 'top movers' in the trade tab by clicking search, then it will show up as a button below. Been using for years and never had a problem. However this latest update took away something I use daily. The trade tab doesn't show the top movers anymore. Now there is only a small section on the main page that shows a few top movers, but you can't see a list of them like you used to. Please fix this."
2024-01-02 06:50:29,"I don't recommend this platform to anyone. It takes forever to get hold of anyone for assistance with customer service(hour wait).Customer service ends the chat abruptly before providing any help. Because i tried to get some assistance on my issue, they have now locked my account. Supposedly , they escalated my issue(which won't see any positive outcome) Fees are higher compared to other competitors. Also, the app lags during navigation. Based on my experience, I can't recommend this to anyone."
2023-11-06 20:29:44,It was fine until it wasn't. My app wouldn't open so I emailed the support center to let them know of the potential bug issue. I received an automated email saying that my email address was disabled and that I couldn't send them email anymore. The email offered a help/contact us link which referred me back to the app that doesn't work. It's annoying. I would hate for my coins to be doing numbers only to find out that I don't have access to them. I will be look elsewhere for better service.
2023-11-24 11:08:11,"The app is easy to navigate around once you have explored it and get used to it. My issue I have is the ""200$ reward"" which, from what I've heard is a spinning wheel you can try and land on the $200 you get when signing up and investing, you have to invest in more than 100$(isn't stated) to complete the 4 steps it takes and when I figured that out I just had a reoccurring message at the top of my app saying ""your reward will be ready shortly"" ( I never received a reward at all and still haven't)"
2024-04-14 21:53:45,Handy enough to use. Pretty clear and you can review every transaction before you buy. One thing is when sending crypto to your wallet they display your key to send too but your name not beside key so it feels a little unsure......
2024-04-05 00:42:31,"I have been using this app for a long time. It suddenly will not open. The screen goes blank and stays there until the OS says it isn't responding. I installed it on my phone and it works, but not my tablet."
2024-04-12 18:57:24,"High fees, holds your crypto forever before you can send it elsewhere. Looking for a new exchange I don't like the way coinbase does things anymore. Now they try to charge a network fee that's more than the crypto I'm trying to send. This is getting worse by the day. They obviously care more about money than you."
2024-04-14 22:14:48,I have used this for over a year with no problems until recently.Same paypal same bank account for the entire year. I have tried to cash out and suddenly it's incredibly glitchy. I'm not sure what's going on with this company but I would advise against signing up .
2024-04-12 22:51:54,"Best app and wallet for beginners. Highly recommend it, simple interface and easy to use platform and web 3 wallet combination make it ideal for any crypto enthusiast."
2024-04-13 16:18:53,The new passkey option is broken and I can't log in at all. Had worked with no problems before the login changes. Will change to 5 stars when that feature is fixed
2024-04-09 05:34:04,"Having trouble on just logging in for Indonesian users. The chance for successful log-in is basically fifty2 chance. Please fix this. And also appreciate if there's a stablecoin soon for users outside US residents. Aside from that, it could've been a great app for me to use daily"
2024-04-09 22:20:32,Been using coinbase for a while now but won't allow me to change my phone number for my new number so I can access my account. This app has become useless now. People say crypto is a scam and I believe it is not but coin base is making it a reality update 04/09/24 still locked out of account after verifying who I am and will not update my phone number that I got from bell mobilty
2024-04-10 23:57:56,"Coinbase is pretty awesome. At 53 years old, I knew nothing of trading. Especially like this. They even pay you to learn. It's awesome. I've only been trading for 2 months. I started with $7.50. it's went up as far as $27.50 and right back down to where I started. Lol. But I keep trading and converting. Chasing the dream."
2023-12-13 17:58:19,"The app is OK but using web version has been horrible lately. Painfully slow loading to the extent that makes me think about switching to another exchange. If you do day trading using PC, this is definitely a no go! Ironically, most often users complain about mobile version, this is the opposite case. Switching browsers, cleaning cashe, DNS etc. I'm running Windows 11, and all other exchanges with data reach content load almost instantly. Don't lose clients, fix your Web based exchange!"
2024-02-07 04:29:38,"Purchased bitcoin with my PayPal account. Was then made aware there would be a seven day hold before I could use said bitcoin. Immediately sold bitcoin back, for a loss, and attempted to transfer funds back to my PayPal balance. There was also a seven day hold on this. I contacted support to explain that this was unacceptable, and magically, the next day, the hold on my money was increased to ONE MONTH. ABSOLUTELY ABSURD. I see this as theft. No less."
2024-03-21 15:20:06,Constant issues being down or restricted trading when trading volume gets high. I haven't been able to even access the app in over 12 hours or trade for over 48 hours....tens of thousands of dollars completely inaccessible. This should be considered a crime EDIT: Oh I have contacted your support team.....they suck and were zero help. Wasted hours of my time on multiple occasions without a single resolution
2024-04-14 18:50:44,"I'm trying to figure it out, and as far as I know I have a great time with learning the ropes by getting educated with the basics knowledge offer to do so and with a gain of coins to sweet things even more. DON'T GIVE THEM A CHANCE, BUT GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE TO GET THE GUIDANCE YOU WOULD NEED TO SAY OTHERWISE. HOW, NEVER JUDGEMENTAL MINDS ARE PLEASE."
2024-01-06 19:26:31,"1/6/24 Continues to be.. Shocking in it's incompetence. Hands down the most horrifically terrible app of the big crypto services available. Both in functionality and stability. All the design decisions are clearly being driven by the marketing team. Endless notifications about things to spend fiat on. This monster is more of an advertising platform than a trading app. EDIT: Flat out dies when switching back to it, refusing to refresh data. Need to kill it and wait several minutes for it to start"
2024-04-12 22:06:19,"Out of all the crypto trading apps this one is my least favorite. Feels outdated, lags alot, and sometime it won't let me cash out so I have to pay a 15 dollar fee just to send my funds to another trading platform to cash out."
2024-01-05 19:56:18,"I have been using the app since Sept of 2021. It really has grown on me. I especially like how they combined advanced trade all in one app. I hated switching back and forth. I'm still learning the limit and stop limit options. The only thing I think I would like better if if a sell is executed and completed in the advanced trade, that I get a notification. I have to constantly keep looking at my phone. I would like to just set it and forget it. Over all great app."
2024-03-30 21:15:15,I really like the fact that if I don't remember my information I can't get into my account without working it out with customer service. 24 hrs later I am able to log in.. it's great security has kept me safe. Customer service is awesome and really do work hard for you.
2024-03-08 18:12:34,"Don't trust it. Not surprisingly, any massive move in the market, you cannot sell or buy. Even with limit already set in both directions. Akin to casino's forced to have enough to pay out all bets in the house: if the system cannot handle such activity, (yea right) you should not allow that much traffic to continue it's failure. Period. Good fiat on-ramp. Works well if you're alone in the market... 🤔 pssht"
2024-03-14 04:27:48,"Since the recent update, I cannot open the app to access my funds. the app keeps complain about unavailability of internet and this went on for a month. Now I have uninstall and reinstalled the app. The problem still persist. Please do sth about this issue so that I can access my account. Thanks"
2024-04-02 20:52:23,"Would be nice if I could get into the app. Registration didn't complete, can't reset password, can't re-register as email is already recognised. Can't contact support as you need to he logged in to do so. Not helpful at all."
2024-03-12 13:13:22,"...so, now they have started charging you to withdraw to paypal. Which was always free. It even says its free still, but they sneak the fee (thats the same price as instant withdraw to debit) onto the confirmation screen. Unethical. Fraudulent. Unscrupulous.....but also, somehow, unsurprising."
2024-04-09 10:21:05,"I've downloaded and explored many of the exchange apps but I like Coinbase the best. Very user friendly, especially with their learning rewards options."
2023-10-30 00:13:58,"App has become unresponsive. I keep getting a security alert that states my device might be rooted but it's not. After closing that notification, it won't let me press any button. I've tried clearing app data/cache, rebooting the phone, reinstalling app, checking if my phone is rooted, updating OS, changing network connection but issue still persists. I'm able to access my account from a web browser. Using Coinbase Assistant has also proven to be unproductive."
2024-04-09 03:52:30,"Coinbase versus my first entry into the crypto world and I do not regret it one bit. It's one of the easiest and best places to learn about crypto to earn crypto and just experience the whole crypto world. I recommend it to all my friends and even people who are at my friends. They should all try it and once you get well versed in the world of crypto, you move on to coinbase pro two apps you must have"
2024-04-09 19:09:50,This app is so cool you can do challenges to get free money and you can also stake your crypto which means you can gain more money over type but you can't touch it or sell it the only reason why I rate this 4 stars is because of the limit on your card I've already fully verified my acc but I still have a limit it's fine though it's so if someone hacks your account they can't just buy alot of crypto with you card all around this app is really good and recommend it for beginners like my self
2024-03-10 17:36:09,Glitches and laggy Not showing real time prices and volume It can be dangerous Tried many times to reach out to support team and every time they said we are working on it. Once they said there are on going issues. I would recommend to think about other exchanges They never gave me support case number saying too busy with extremely high volume of cases
2024-03-21 19:16:15,I still give this app a 0! They have frozen my money and do not understand any country outside the US. They requesting like 30 documents that I don't have because I invested 150$ that was a wedding gift and I thought crypto would be fun. All the resources and it still feels like an automated response. If I had millions I might understand why they don't want you to avoid tax. Now I can't even move my money back. This is called stealing!
2024-03-15 13:41:48,"Haha funny, let's keep signing me out for no reason haha. So funny the 10th time, making me sign in twice per attempt so it actually goes through. So hilarious, making me do 2fa twice a day. Sometimes I can go days without a problem, sometimes it's every day. Also, thanks for letting me invest into something that day later became unsupported by coinbase, and my 3x profit disappeared. Luckily, it was only a £5."
2024-04-15 23:16:25,I pay for the membership but the app lacks so much. During volatility get ready to not be able to open the app. It's gonna be interesting to see during the halving how the app will react. Profit and loss calculators when purchasing crypto are all off. Good look with uncle Sam on when coinbase is handling my gains and loss ledger. I have purchased a token let's say 1.00 I sold it and it says I'm up 2k on it. 🙂 Makes zero sense. Thanks coinbase I've reached out and no answer.
2024-03-30 04:33:19,"I've been using coinbase since 2021ish and have loved it ever since I started. It's a great exchange to buy, sell, and store many different crypto currencies. I really like the learn to earn tasks in the app that help get you some knowledge and funds in the diverse sphere that is crypto."
2024-02-10 03:52:08,"I AM NOT tech savvy at all. App is pretty easy to understand, But with anything new, it does take about a week to get down. The Newsdesk is cool to read and understand each coin bull/bearish outlook. And helps you to guage when it's time to buy and sell. If you're looking for simplicity. Here you have it."
2024-02-14 21:37:34,Charged 2 percent slippage upon converting ETH to USDC which is their native coin. Did not provide details while making the transaction. This is a SCAM! I contacted support and they said nothing can be done. 2% is a huge amount while making a big transaction and details should be upfront and clear before customer can make a transaction!
2024-03-07 02:00:00,"Excellent platform, does lag a bit, due to a major jump of users trading, when a coin jumps, I think. Works good for me, maybe update hardware, going to be lots of new traders this year and beyond."
2024-01-04 21:37:34,"Using this app feels like an android user trying to navigate IOS. I just want a simple display that shows all of my assets, what I paid for them and their performance stats at the same time. It's frustrating to have to navigate all over the place to see these stats individually. The app does what it's supposed to. I can buy and sell assets. But the user interface could really use a LOT of improvements to organize my portfolio in an easy yet detailed way to view them."
2023-10-29 13:05:31,Was good. Especially with pro. Now it seems like constant trouble. Can't even login when i want!! I press sign in and it keeps saying error. I've tried restarting my phone. Closeing the app out and restarting it. Even uninstalling and reinstalling....keeps doing the same thing...I'm paying for all this for it to act like this. I am missing out because of this. I'd give it a 0 stars if i could.
2024-03-29 23:29:37,Coinbase is good. I would have given a five star but I tried coinbase 1 and it wasnt what I expected. They advertise no trading fees while upping non trading fees where you will end up paying the same along with a 29.00 monthly fee. Also Coinbase one says when you purchase crypto you will get credit for the amount you purchased but it's basically the same. I do like Coinbase though. Their support is friendly and always willing to help with issues
2024-03-23 15:03:29,"coinbase app is Great, superb,and excellent. easy to navigate, and easy to use. coinbase app provides up to date prices, reasonable fee. provides up to date on all markets. provides rewards for education on markets."
2024-03-25 22:49:21,The app unlinked my bank account and then took money from the account and overdrew it but wouldn't link back up using Plaid so I could put money back into the account. It worked ok a couple of years ago. At least they have customer service that is human and speak English. That's nice.
2024-03-20 13:57:44,Locking ppl accounts and sending fishing looking emails to send all your info away. Emails are mass generated confusing mess. Every other broker has in app built-ins for that. Terrible experience of comply or you can't use your funds!
2023-12-04 17:34:25,"THERE ARE BETTER, LESS EXPENSIVE APPS!! A $30 monthly fee on top of the astronomical transfer fees? Absolutely not using this. That's robbing people that are unsure and trying to experiment with a confusing platform already. Which is probably exactly why it's designed this way. At no time was I aware it was only a trial and I'd be charged $30 monthly for depositing $25 to see how things worked."
2024-04-12 06:35:41,not able to sign up an account due to the the camera being blurry in your app. tried to take multiple shots of my ID but it always comes out blurry. please fix.
2024-03-05 03:14:18,Do not waist your time this app will stop you from making money !!!!the app limits the amount you deposit even when you see it clearly from you bank account and when you r trying to add more money to The account to buy... and I called the customer service the give a call ba k after 6 or 7 hrs .. and she didn't help with anything just read the Help support article...
2024-02-15 10:34:36,"I have been using this for over a year , and while it was a steap learning curve, i have made money! Not a lot, but I mind you, i haven't invested big amounts ! But I have tripled my investments! Best hold for the long term , you won't make money overnight unless your supper lucky or knows something the rest of us dont!"
2024-02-10 00:44:11,"Great experience and so nice to learn and earn, times are tough and interesting is hard when stretching a dollar. Hopefully there are more opportunities. Even earn a $ 2 reward on a brush up lesson or if there are changes made to a platform. Other than that 5 stars."
2024-02-05 17:26:30,"The platform is a little different but the advanced trading option is unreal. Easy to figure out for those who know trading, for a novice it would only take minutes to understand. Full of options and access to realtime information as it's happening. You can literally do anything that any other software does. All in one place. I'm a beginner but I research before I commit. I'm excited about MY future on this app. Anyone not taking full advantage is losing out."
2024-03-04 19:05:35,Cannot use Coinbase any more. App gets stuck in a loop of me logging in - it asking me if I am an elected official - me saying no - and then back to the start. Website does the same but when you say no it just throws an error. I now only want to sign in to close my account because this is total garbage.
2023-12-31 13:23:42,"I get alerts of crypto prices to log in and see nothing reflected to the alert. So many times the amounts jump all over with no change but drastic changes in the overall amount. The app does not keep up with how much changes every second. Fees are high, sell orders are confusing. Can't wait till i get rid of all this garbage and move on from this app and crypto in general."
2023-11-30 01:35:16,"The worst. What kind of exchange only has a small portion of the available coins/tokens? I guess only enough to be able to frontrun each & every addition. Swap $20, states fee of $0.24, end up with $18.51. This happens EVERY time, even when it was ""free"" before. No actual swapping even occurs behind the scenes so HOW do i ALWAYS lose a nice chunk of my money?! Equivalent of a bank, can't be trusted with money. Period. Defeats the entire purpose crypto was made for in the first place."
2024-04-16 03:21:14,"Worst app ever. Go to sign in on my phone and it asks me for a code from my email. Put it in, and then it asks me to verify again through email... After all of this I'm right back to the original log in page...."
2024-04-10 06:26:10,"This joke of an application is unable to verify me as I cannot complete a question that doesn't appear at all on their verification questionaire. Not only that, but I also can't complete the same questionnaire online either."
2023-12-16 10:11:13,"Good phone app. However: 1. App only displays dates in the illogical and confused US date format (MM/DD/YYYY). It would be greatly improved if you offered the option to display dates in the far more logical UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY), in which the units displayed get progressively larger as you move to the right. This simple improvement should be extremely easy for you to implement. 2. Warning at the top of all pages is irritating, though I appreciate this is imposed on you by the state."
2024-01-26 02:31:09,"Horrible Guys..!!Be extremely Safe. Customer support is of no help at all..In the mid of tails of Email going for an issue, they simoly stop responding at all..In my case it continuously aak for Verification though i have verified myself several times with confirmation Email Rexeived. .If in any case you get stuck by there ayatem glitch then all ia gone as there is no one to assist and advise. [Reply] Case #16632783 [Reply] Case #17728123"
2023-11-01 12:38:02,It has been totally unusable for quite some time. Now I cannot click anything on the screen. Nothing responds. I have reported this and they told me that this is a known issue and yet it still persists and makes the app totally unusable. I'm not the only one with this issue. Don't tell me to go troubleshooting because it's definitely something on your end. EDIT: Finally fixed!
2024-02-19 19:11:17,"Having issues with rewards and it is completely impossible to create a support ticket. The virtual assistant is utterly useless. Does not understand the simplest questions. Amazingly, the support form does not submit either. What a joke. Would have given zero stars if I could."
2024-03-31 23:08:26,I have attempted 6 times to verify using my DL. Every time it says cannot verify. In fact I even updated and bought a duplicate DL costing me $15 just to use this app. Customer service is non existent. As far as I'm concerned coinbase owes me $15 for the inconvenience. All my info is correct. Fix your app.
2023-12-09 01:15:59,"Lost 50$ to this app and i've given up on it. Its not very intuitive or easy to learn from as a beginner. It's unclear on how sending and transfers work and for me they havent worked at all. when i tried to withdraw or sell the money, that didn't work either. I was prepared to lose the money incase it didnt work, but it's still pretty disappointing to see a hyped up app be such a let down. Same with the coinbase wallet app. The two are supposed to work together and they simply don't."
2023-12-20 17:29:03,The app is full of glitches to be a secure app. Closed out on me several times while trying to cash out. It now says I've reached my limit and have to wait 12hrs even though it never went through with the transaction and kept kicking me out. I don't understand how the system doesn't know the transaction didn't go through. My history even shows my attempts as completed even though they didn't. Very frustrating.
2024-02-26 20:12:14,"Good app, good exchange. Would use more, but Coinbase really limits the amount of funds I can add from my bank. Even after being fully verified, giving Plaid access to view my bank account, and having 2+ months of good history with using Coinbase I am still limited to $2000 total per month for ACH bank transfers via Plaid. I like this app better than Kracken. However, Kracken allows ach deposits via Plaid up to 10k per week."
2024-02-28 18:42:49,"Do not use this app, it used to be really good and reliable but after the ""assessments"" which thankfully i have not had the pleasure ask me to complete yet, however seeing how many people have now been removed from buying on this application has really put me off, trying to cash out and its saying i can only take half of what i actually have, id understand if it was through fees but it just states ""amount is too large insufficient funds"" but ive requested less than the amount in, seems dodgy"
2024-01-22 05:58:09,The app is trash. Isn't letting me convert. Takes too long to let me add cash or withdraw. I'm 95% sure it double charged me on a processing issue. I added my debit card which is instant cash additions for every other app and the app wants to take it out three hours later. The whole app is trash. I'll move my business else. I do NOT trust CoinBase.
2024-04-16 00:00:45,"Probably the best crypto platform to use. It's easy, it's quick and simple, they give you educational tasks with a one question test to earn free crypto in which you can trade, sell or spend. I've used multiple crypto platforms and all in all coinbase probably has the best set up for anyone to use."
2023-12-17 20:46:46,Been having a lot of problems with this lately. It's very slow and cannot get to transactions to go through on time and ends up. Trying to do it 3 or 4 times when there is no money in the bank to do it. And I have lost over $80000 American because of technical issues. They cannot send the money to my coin base wallethey're telling me would appreciate this being fixed $80000. American is a lot of money to lose
2024-03-20 18:16:04,This thing is slow. Infinite loading circles in various menus or cryptos. Paying for Coinbase One for a bit and it's a rip off. Need to allow options and future trading.
2024-04-01 02:25:37,"4 hour wait time for support! Then they disconnect if you don't respond in 2 minutes. Learning rewards do not pay as much as they claim. I was supposed to get $10, and instead they gave me $0.07! Higher then average trade fees. Plenty of better crypto apps out there, this one's a joke"
2024-03-26 04:36:14,"It's not too late, well for btc it kind of is and long term it will continue to grow but as it stands at 500k% gains from 2009 to now at $70,000... keep in mind btc is basically too big to fail at this point however as you know how fast technology advances and in the 2020 peak to now it has been outdone in efficiency at astronoical rates as well. Going down as the pioneer of the block chain concept and the decentralized movement.. coinbase teaches you all of this and often pays you to learn!"
2024-03-24 21:57:33,"Long time Buddy of mine got me to finally try out this new digital coin just shy 3yrs ago. I wouldn't trust any others than coinbase. Security is solid, lot's of tool features, there is zero fee options for transactions."
2024-03-24 08:41:10,After a longgggg straggle I verified my account by trying my every documents and also bank statement and now when I want to start trading it's showing payment method doesn't support in my region 😕 (UAE) what's that meaning??? You can mention first before submitting my documents. But after everything done you say payment not support 🤦
2024-03-26 16:01:40,"Bad app if you want to sell at peak Twice now in the last month the app AND website has crashed during peak buying and selling situations resulting in the loss of 100s of dollars. To small investors this is a big deal, but good luck in trying go reach customer service. I'll be contacting the AG tomorrow to lodge my complaint."
2024-03-24 09:42:56,"Easy to use, has learning rewards, inciteful, and although staking percantages are lower than other exchanges, coinbase's approach of handling the filtering out of as many risks to its users as it could is very assuring and probably worth the extra percanteges other exchanges offer. Oh and did i mention ease of use, learning rewards, filtering of the risks associated with crypto, and basically guiding you by the hand thru the world of defi/crypto"
2024-03-22 18:18:46,"You're lucky I can't leave no stars. Your customer service is a complete scam. If and when you have an issue with your account, Coinbase's chat representatives will do and say anything to not help you with your issue. Disgusting Update 3/22/24: Like I said, your customer service is atrocious and a scam. I did what you asked and followed the link after 7 hours of trying, the submit button that allows you to submit and finalize your claim DOES NOT work. I've tried on 2 computers and 3 phones."
2024-03-28 10:21:21,Zero stars honestly!!! Its going over a year and I still do not have my balance turns! And I still can not make purchases what's the point of having coinbase if you can not buy coins on coinbase. I will be changing my review rating until my balance transfer has been resolved I'm tired of the wait I wan results now! 😕
2024-03-25 14:32:54,Really bad app. Not very well developed. The sell option doesn't work for most of the time. It just keeps loading and doesn't show up anything
2024-03-22 21:44:32,"Added PayPal and card and still can't cash out, never used to be like this. Customer service is just bot or automated message, if you call you won't get through to anyone it just hangs up. Cannot even get a case number."
2024-03-20 13:19:05,It was good at first. But I needed to update my information like my phone number. There is nowhere to do that on the app at all. They want you to show your ID again just to update something simple like a new phone number. I hope they will let me have access to my crypto again.
2024-04-01 07:04:43,"Needlessly difficult to get verified compared to other exchanges. I've uploaded every type of address ID possible bank statements, lease agreement, license, phone bill, tax statement etc all rejected saying different country to the one of my account???? Why refuse new customers like this or please employ competent people."
2024-04-01 02:35:24,"Love coinbase, app is sluggish some time especially when there is high demand. Fees are very high but has nominal fees with advanced trading. CoinbaseOne is good but does not help with advanced trading, however I liked the fact that 25% of the fee is returned in usdc."
2024-03-26 15:43:29,"Even though I have provided the correct documents many times over I wasn't verified when I tried to contact with the support team, nobody got back to me. The app doesn't even deserve a star as there's no one who actually would be willing to help when you need to seek help."
2024-03-24 16:54:48,"Definitely the worst exchange I've used so far. Fees are high, application is slow, customer service is garbage I wouldn't recommend this application to anyone."
2024-04-01 13:34:33,"Staking rewards have been dropping over the past year. If this trend continues, I will transfer all of my assets to a different exchange as well as canceling my coinbase one. After 5 years of use, this is disappointing. Thank you for the tax help though."
2024-03-21 19:28:02,"A restriction was placed on my account immediately, not letting me use the currency that I had purchased. At no point was it disclosed when I deposited funds and purchased the crypto that I would not be able to use it for 7 days. Support is not helpful and simply spams me with ""It's been a while since your last response. Please respond to continue the conversation."""
2024-03-27 14:30:41,The only problem I'm having is being able to change and update my phone number so I can sign in it's trying to send me a code and I cannot send it to the correct number it has my old number and it will not allow me to update it because I cannot sign in it's just like overlook using the link and phone number provided nothing works email doesn't work please get ahold of me ASAP so I can log into my account
2024-03-24 13:31:44,Safe!!! I understand it. I refer new users all the time. Yes the fees are higher but the safety of my Crypto off the grid is worth it. They have been in this since 2011. Great CEO. Blackrock uses them to hold their coin. All ya need to know
2024-03-20 21:06:28,Why can't i see the % changes for my assets while in my asset list? App changes over the past few months have made out more difficult to keep track of the movement of my assets. It would so much easier to see these changes in the summary view rather than having to go into each asset's detail page.
2024-03-25 13:21:28,It's so simple to use and gives all the tools you need to help you make your investments ! I have not been payed in Usd but instead ive been getting payed in crypto for the last 2 and a half years and I love it ! Crypto changed my life the good all because of Coinbase !
2024-03-18 16:51:40,"I chose this because I was told it was the easiest for beginners and it's a joke. Interface is convoluted and you can only buy $5 of bitcoin per WEEK, unless you directly link your bank account. It's designed for whales and to keep anyone else out of the club."
2024-03-13 20:29:23,"Honestly I love you, Coinbase, but this implementation of automatically selling my BTC (for example) and converting it to USDC UNLESS I switch to cash, is infuriating. I lost money because I didn't remember to uncheck this poor, new feature. I do not want anything to do with USDC so please let the default selling to USDC come to a stop."
2023-11-06 23:13:54,"I absolutely hate this app. The fees are extremely high, super buggy it makes you verify over and over again, it lured me in with a "" guaranteed "" chance to win bitcoin upto $200 with first purchase but then after my first purchase The ad goes away and you never hear about it ever again. didn't win or even get a chance to win anything, false advertising. I did a wire transfer in which was fast but then they restricted my account. so now the money is locked in coinbase only. AVOID THIS APP"
2024-03-26 15:14:32,"Although not bad, the app is mostly focused on the USA, while the Canadian side of the software continously causes issues. At this moment I can not fund my account because it shows US behind my name. Yet, I have been able to fund my account frequently. What I am saying is: the software is unstable. And reaching coinbase helpdesk is hell."
2023-11-25 02:21:43,"Latest update sucks. The removal of basic trading is understandable, but that section of the interface was a vital part of how I used the app. Because of the Advanced Trading only l, I no longer have access to my previously established watch lists. Also, the interface was much simpler for accessing things regarding my Coinbase Card. Furthermore, I can no longer seem to locate anything that gives me information regarding my cost basis, and I can no longer lookup untradeable coins in app. FIX IT"
2024-02-04 12:52:02,"Between the ABSOLUTELY SHOCKINGLY TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and EXTORTIONALY HIGH FEES compared to many other providers COINBASE HAS BECOME AN UNVIABLE & UNUSABLE EXCHANGE. I've deleted this app today. I was keeping it for an emergency offramp from my cold storage wallet, but the debit card never works, and they slap MASSIVE UNNECESSARY FEES on ALL TRANSACTIONS. Not good for buying, selling or holding. R.I.P Coinbase, you are now USELESS."
2024-03-18 13:44:18,"Avoid!!! Coinbase is a scam! My crypto cannot be transferred to an external wallet, so Coinbase is essentially freezing my account. There is zero customer support to resolve. Tried calling the international number but customer service not available in my region. For a seemingly global service provider, they are hideously incompetent."
2024-03-07 00:51:35,"Coinbase automatically opted my assets to staked without my aurthorization. Tried to contact them but its a forever Bot and no response. I've unstaked my assets and now have to wait a month and hope the market is still going well. When I finally get whatever is left gains or losses, I will discontinue using this platform. I'm not sure why it automatically changed my purchases from primary to staked other than to prevent me from being able to profit from my investment. No stars"
2024-01-09 18:11:56,"Poor log in. I do like coinbase, never had a problem before. However, I've have numerous times of trying to log in. I've passed all the verification and texts, 2-steps, you name it, I've done it. It still will not let me log in. It just buffers when using the login button, or it suddenly says login cancelled. Please coinbase can you sort this out, I don't want to take my business elsewhere, but I feel I may have to."
2024-01-06 18:38:44,"The ad tells you that you create the account and you get paid $200. I created the account and there's literally nothing in app that mentions the $200 after creating it. The balance is $0.00. Even if I do get help to get the $200, it's obviously not just creating the account which makes the ad's claims false and I originally downloaded it for the other claim it made about watching videos and learning about crypto. The selling points from the ad shouldn't be things that you have to hunt for."
