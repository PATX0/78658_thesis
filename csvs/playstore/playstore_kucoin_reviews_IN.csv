2022-01-21 04:04:26,"Surely my favorite app. So far so good, be nice if fees were less though. I haven't had any issues with the exchange, but I'm not a trader right now, I traded in so much coins, so I can't comment on it as a trading platform for that. The fees do seem pretty high, especially when buying low priced coins. If they could lower the fees it would a lot on those. Being able to set limit orders and track gain or loss would be nice. Gain and loss is even on more smooth. Overall satisfied with that."
2024-02-09 23:45:34,"Absolutely awful experience so far. The face validation kept telling me my nose was covered (it was not), the add a credit card validation keeps telling me my information is incorrect (it's not, but maybe something about the really weird way they want it added is incompatible with my address? I don't know. I tried two credit cards). My problems are completely different than the reviews below mine too which should tell you this app has a whole host of potential glitches! Still have no crypto. :("
2024-03-06 23:21:51,"The app is good, however it needs some improvements, such as, in the notifications, you should be able to send notification of tokens that the user hold instead of just other tokens that the user dont even hold, just add the tokens the user hold in the notifications too. Improve the performance of the app, currently for mobile devices the app is way slower than the web version for PC, one example is how long the ads that show after the welcome screen, stays even after the time has already expire"
2024-03-30 19:41:47,"The app is good, but the service really sucks period i've been waiting for over three and a half weeks for them to reset a pin code. During this time, I can not trade and can not transfer. Cannot even withdraw my funds because of an additional pin code that they added. And I'm at their mercy waiting for 3 and a 1/2 weeks for them to reset it so that I continue processing,l. DO NOT USE THIS APP. Do not use this service."
2024-04-01 06:18:33,Horrible app. Too much stuff happening in the app. Cannot access the account via web browser. It always firces you to download load the app. The app is a utter mess. Purchases can be done through specific trading coins. Can't buy it because app is unable to fulfill the verification for the Legend Trading. Truly legendary. They fail at doing the basic thing. They ruined it.
2024-04-09 12:33:47,"This app is the most frustrating thing l have ever seen within crypto space, l won't even advise my enemies to use them, Downloaded this useless app today, have been trying to convert my token,but am aren't allowed to select the token l want to convert to, l only have usdt and BTC on the convert space which l have been trying to change but wasn't allowed to, trying reaching out to their support, but couldn't see anyone to chat with, very frustrating people."
2024-04-06 21:46:41,"1 star is even over rating this app, lost access to my account, created a ticket, submitted every needed information they required to set a new email address, 7 weeks later, no answer and I'm the one chasing for an information. I don't recommend this app. You can trade elsewhere. This is the poorest service center I've ever seen all business types included. Cripto platforms shouldn't have help centers with no SLAs. We are talking about trades happening in milliseconds. Please."
2024-03-31 00:44:27,"Dear KC team, I'm using app since long time , but now values don't update timely, future contract don't show or even app don't load data often when I find any coin by typing, and also takes more time to load even it exists in memory. Also add a sound alert option to check/mark for total balance in assets. Please resolve these issues."
2024-04-01 15:53:34,"I was attracted to join kucoin for trading and kucard service. As an experienced trader I was expecting much more from Kucoin. Unfortunately I was met with a barrage of inconveniences right from the start...with the verification scanner not working properly. Pretty annoying when you are busy and you have limited time. Suport is hard to reach, they reply after an hour when you are not watching your phone anymore and they hit and run: sent me a pretty automatic looking meesage then dissapeared."
2024-04-16 05:05:35,"I don't recommend it at all. This exchange is a fraud in the true sense. I transferred my tokens from wallet to here but didn't get my tokens here. I contacted them, but they said you paid wrong, and we're unable to refund you. In fact, I transferred tokens to the exact deposit address they given and I provided them with details, yet they didn't do anything for funds recovery."
2024-04-08 13:11:20,"Terrible experience so far. I have been trying to retrieve my trading password to no avail. The camera identification doesn't work, online customer chats never respond. Emails don't get responded to and when they do, they give you false hope of a speedy solution which never comes. Now my funds are stich and can't withdraw. It looks like the trading password was invented to frustrate customers because other exchange apps don't need them."
2024-04-01 16:25:05,They did not give the referal rewards they promised. Do not use this this exchange. Also the support is awful and their app always shows unavoidable full screen promotions when you open it and you have to sit there and wait until they go away. Awful experience.
2024-04-11 20:30:34,"I've been using kucoin app for long now, and it has been running smoothly, but after the recent update, I've been trying to convert some coins but it's not working, once I reach to the stage of selecting the coin I want to convert it will hang there"
2024-03-26 19:50:17,"I was allowed to deposit , but was requesting for email otp when making withdrawal attempt several times. I didn't get opt via my email. I tried until I got frustrated and resold the coin I supposed to withdrawal out to make online payment. Causing me to buy at higher price and sell at loss. Then I used added money to buy usdt from another platform and was able to withdrawal successfully. I may not use this platform again in the future. I was so disappointed üòû"
2024-04-06 23:55:52,"The only time I've ever had my money dissappear using a blockchain was when trying to send it to Kucoin. I double checked the address many times before clicking send, and again after it didn't arrive. I can guarentee i did copy and paste the address properly since the tab was still open i can confirm there was no mistakes in the pasting of wallet address. Kucoin ""Customer Service"" just tells me that address does not exist on their platform. Thats it. Thats all the help I got. I"
2024-04-09 01:54:26,"It's one of the best crypto exchange i've used so far. But lately i can't convert any coin. When i click on the kucoin convert button, it quickly return back to the home page. This is so annoying. Please help me fix that."
2024-03-05 21:07:02,"I haven't done any review on any app on playstore ever but I had to do this because I'm was marveled by kucoin!! is there/are there no regulations for the p2p transactions!!!! When you chose a p2p ad for trade, you'll be notified that the ad price has changed and the change % is drastically different üòÇ, almost 80% of them do change at the point of trade, pls the price should be at least stable, all ads which price has been changed should be indicated üôèüèø and only available ads should be shown"
2024-02-25 21:43:45,Used to be a good app however in the last couple of months the touchscreen is not working. I need to click on a coin 4-5 times to open it. Also kucoin does not give you the options to turn off notifications for coins not watching. I am constantly being notified about coins I dont watch or care about. My review has changed from 5 to 1 star because the app was working perfectly and now it doesn't.
2024-02-14 18:36:57,"It's a shame how you ""welcome"" New users by setting up a more than shady rewards system. Basically you always end up one step below the requirement to cash out. I thought I was unlucky but this basically happens to everyone. Even more scammy is though you make it look random. This sets up the first - very bad - customer experience. I already feel being cheated, before I actually started to get going."
2024-04-16 06:43:02,I would be very wary of this app. A scam operator registered in an offshore that does not allow withdrawal under false claims of security and all kinds of nonsense. I wouldn't spend a single dollar with them. Cannot be trusted!
2024-03-10 02:59:20,"the chat displays an error called ""websocket in connect"" many times, even when the Internet is stable. This sometimes affect an order execution due to inability to respond to other party's messages. This has to be improved. It's a strange experience."
2024-03-04 21:55:54,I am really having bad experience with this app. I have tried many times to convert my coins to usdt but the keep asking me to enter my trading password of which I don't remember entering during the registration process. I was compelled to do two way verification with my phone number Google authenticator and even my email yet I couldn't convert nor withdraw. This is actually making me think that this app is not secured. I will rate 5tar if this is resolved
2024-03-10 06:48:39,"Very very bad experience. Don't put your deposit in KuCoin because yesterday I credited one dollar to check whether this platform is good. Unfortunately, one dollar is transferred from the Binance BSC network. But still, it is not transferred to the KuCoin app. I checked all the confirmations are completed. This is worse Thanks to Almighty, I didn't transfer the big amount"
2024-02-19 08:11:12,Don't know what happened after the previous 2 updates. App is so unresponsive to touches. Quite frustrating to use now. Very terrible and super unresponsive to any touch inputs in most of the menu. Dev team please fix this ASAP!
2024-02-02 15:02:53,"Overall one of the better exchanges. Unfortunately, it is no longer available in my area. No ACH deposits possible, must use usdt, usdc... Good inteface, some staking options, many crypto... Does not provide any easy way to track loss/gain of you whole investment or individual buys."
2024-03-09 02:45:21,"DO NOT DEPOSIT YOUR $$$ HERE They locked out my withdraws for no good reason, they wanted info on my xrp deposit of $100, I provided it to them 10 days ago they said they would get back to me within 7 days still nothing back from the email/ticket I go to try there customer service again and get sent to the beginning and my funds are still locked. There not responding to my emails. Edit: it's been over a month and my money is still locked without much communication maybe 1 email every 2.5 week."
2024-03-04 00:23:42,"The exchange is great but there is a major language barrier which makes conversations painful! Here is an example: ""Hi I am having an issue with my futures trades where the SL is so close to the entry even at low leverage it just won't let me adjust the leverage very low"". There answer: ""you know you can adjust the SL right?"". Alot of back and forths go like this so you get no closer to a solution to your problems or they say they are going to transfer you to another person but forget about you"
2024-03-10 10:59:35,"Already filled in KYC data. whereas I couldn't do anything because it was hampered by the SMS verification process. I've entered a different cellphone number 3 times but no code has come through. Meanwhile, if you want to carry out any trading activity, you have to start from top up, while top up requires cell phone number verification. while I can't verify it . if a number in a country where activities are prohibited or activities are restricted is the problem. why are all countries listed in"
2023-11-13 18:10:59,"The behavior of the application is poor and not user-friendly. I have tried multiple times to sign up, but the application doesn't function properly. OTP is not passing, and network errors. Application has been reinstalled, and Android has been restarted several times, but unfortunately, bug still exists. The development of application is highly recommended. Error 429"
2024-04-13 11:23:23,I'll suggest you include bvn as another means of verification for Nigeria users just as bybit did there's that way it's easier to verify because I'm still having issues verifying My account because I don't have a driver's license and my passport as expired the rest governmental ID I'm using you guys are declining it and it's frustrating
2024-03-25 20:38:58,"To use kucoin as exchanger, it's waste of time. I signed up to start trading and they give task. I did the task, when doing the task I lost alot of money and they didn't give me the rewards of the task. Every one should take care, all the task is scam and they have high trading fee unlike bybit and binance. I really regretted. An advice to anyone. DONT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME TO DOWNLOAD THE APP. you better trade with any other exchangers."
2024-03-12 06:44:38,I have been trying to get verification code via my registered phone number since the past 24hrs and it hasn't been responding. I have pending appeals from P2P transaction and customer support is not assisting. I have also tried to chat with online customer support but to no avail. This is frustrating and makes me doubt the efficiency and legitimacy of Kucoin.
2024-03-26 23:38:26,rewards for new user promo is a scam. you need to get $30 from their gacha rewards. you will get exactly. $29. and the last step is advanced trading where you will need $16k in spot and $18k in futures. what a total scam. you cannot get that $30 invitation promo for new user.
2024-03-04 05:08:17,Terrible first time experience. The app has refused to send code i can't withdraw or trade coin in my wallet. On contacting suppprt i was told they will get back to me in few days which i find very concerning. The app is frustrating to use
2024-04-10 11:35:59,I'm unable to deposit it says for to ensure the security of your account this transaction has been terminated been terminated I'm very frustrated by this issue I tried to contact with customer care support but it's not connecting I'm also unable to login in my account it saying system error
2023-12-23 09:14:10,"Lots of annoying promo animated/sliding ads. You can't even open the app without being shown an ad for several seconds that can't be skipped. Similar if you want price alerts, you will get other relentless promos as distracting notifications on ur phone. Sadly, this means I had to disable notifications for this app and miss out on other actual useful features."
2024-03-24 05:57:29,"very disappointed they doesn't take care of their users. i completed their trading challenge in rewards hub, they Approve withdraw of my bonus but doesn't give my in my Funding account, they Don't give me my rewards, upon asking to Costumer support, they doesn't resolve my issue after one week discussion. They are just lier. they are just Scamming and their costumer support is also very unresponsive. very much disappointed. Doesn't use this Exchangeüö´‚ÄºÔ∏è"
2024-03-22 14:33:06,Can't use in USA. And.... apparently you cannot delete your account. Requires a trading password change and Google verification. Both of which I never enabled anyway. I'm just trying to delete a new account! 3783202
2024-01-31 00:40:13,"Better make sure to set up that trading password when you set up your account. Otherwise it will for you, and you'll need to jump through alot of hoops to reset it. Not very user friendly !!"
2024-03-16 23:47:09,"Useless. Nightmare to get verified waiting months despite receiving positive confirmation of my documents. CS is nothing but bots and canned responses. Can't get a straight answer from anyone. If this is the level of customer service, I wouldn't trust them with my money."
2024-03-04 10:38:40,Make I do hmmmm before I start... First of all I must say u guys have very poor interface for new users and how come it's so hard to change your number.. my number got lost recently and I have been trying to change but it keeps sending code to the lost one.. don't your engineer see how other apps do their change of number.. did you guys not think of people who would try to change number after losing the one they registered with.. pls try to add that in the next update.. na God I use beg ona
2024-02-06 20:29:35,I installed this app and was margin trading after i gotten profits i tried to move it to my futures account and i couldnt i contacted support and this said i should be able to after some days of constant contacting them i clicked on this app and saw my balance on 0 they took all my profits from the margin account without no reason if you have this app with money on it try to take it out fast.
2024-01-30 05:07:07,"This app has some annoying behaviors. I‚Äôve tried many times to receive the OTP via email or phone number, but all I see is ‚ÄòVerification code sent‚Äô, and I‚Äôm not receiving anything."
2024-03-15 08:26:29,"For the past two days, I've not been able to carry out transactions cause it keeps showing ""error in network connection"" even when the network is ok and other CEX are connecting."
2024-03-22 06:39:05,I verified my account when I registered in January 2024 but all of a sudden it reads that my account is being verified for almost 2 weeks now. I cannot even withdraw my assets. Please DO SOMETHING I just want my assets so I use another exchanger. I'm very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è
2024-02-14 08:37:37,"They promise you 20 dollars as a new user and it's easy to reach 19 out of 20 dollars, but to get the final 1 required to withdraw the money, they ask you to deposit 10.000 dollars. What a scam. Will never recommend this app to anyone."
2024-01-16 22:02:13,"Despite entering my correct phone number on file, I've made more than 30 attempts and have yet to receive the SMS verification code. This has not only been inconvenient but also raises concerns about the reliability of their authentication system. It's crucial for KuCoin to address these issues promptly to ensure a smooth user experience and maintain trust within their community. It's frustrating!"
2024-03-21 23:44:49,"Yeah all is good but sometimes it show pop up while open opening it with 3s,2s, 1s but not exit the such pop up which have causes in trading and crypto volatile world. Dear DEVELOPER remove this useless things from app ."
2024-04-06 16:15:12,Very bad. Kukoin removed the direct debit from Visa and MasterCard in the fast trade. Support team keeps answering the same all the time. Their advices don't work but they ignore my answers and sending me the same answer.
2024-04-05 00:27:28,very good interface. could be better if included more options like navigating to order specifics from assets.
2024-04-03 15:22:05,"The new UI sucks, it's laggy, not optimised, bad display and button placement! Change it back, what the hell are you guys doing??"
2024-04-12 09:32:55,"I initially gave 5 stars ‚ú® but I'm changing it because I don't understand, I will purchase or sell coins and it be in order, making me lose money, why can't an order go once, why would an order be pending for more than an hour."
2024-03-31 18:31:50,"You can't even sign up at the first place neither to talk of trading. That Oval verification is just annoying, it always freezes up and the is nothing you can do about it."
2024-04-15 09:43:53,It's been a very nice app until a day before yesterday when someone sent me $20 worth of BTC and until this moment it still haven't dropped in my wallet...plz kindly look into this and get it fixed
2024-04-02 21:48:04,I set the notification to off but you still sending me notifications about other crypto that I do not follow or don't even care. I'm deleting this app. It is invasive.
2024-04-10 21:00:21,"App was very good, but support is lazy and helpless, waiting for card more then 3 months but no card yet. And support is asking sooo stupid questions I had to leave this platform"
2024-02-29 08:05:59,I like it and using frequently. Support is working well and replying asap. Only they need to solve issue that spot trading prices is freezing when you use favorite list.
2024-03-29 13:27:10,"When I try to verify the account, I click on the region. it won't go any farther because it says it says it doesn't support the United States. So I can not go any farther."
2024-03-09 02:12:52,"it's not easy to use, and it's futures trading changes leverage and margin without any notice to user. It's completely defrauding. Use binance and coinex instead."
2024-03-14 17:59:50,"Kucoin what's this?? I was suddenly logged out from my account and requested I enter a code from the authenticator app. After entering the code it still can't log me in. I've waited more than 4 hours to receive a log in code through email and still, nothing arrived.. frustrating! üò≠"
2024-03-04 17:30:48,I have tried dozens of times typing my phone number correctly but I couldn't receive the SMS. The app is giving the verification code on email but then it shifts to phone number and I couldn't receive the SMS.
2024-04-09 01:06:34,The app is ok but I tried to verify my account so many times but It did not verify the account after doing what I was told to do yet after some mins I will go back there and see that my account was not verified. please try and fix this because it is very annoying üò°
2024-03-17 15:48:15,"Withdrawal fee for $111 worth of BTC costs $41 dollars when gas estimators put the transaction at $15-20. Wipes out gains from Link purchase when i WAS a verified user. Had no idea they implemented this additional KYC policy. Received no form of contact. This is, pure and simple, a scam. To respond to the response: ""please pay attention"" lol, wow. The changes to the terms and operation of KC exchange are extreme. How can i pay attention when i receive no notification of the change?"
2024-04-07 11:52:32,"Very sad, how can I buy coin, make full payment, send check, mark paid and I'll be waiting for more than 2 days to get my coin without any reason. I'm so pained because for over 5 years of trading with other platforms I've never experienced such rubbish It's insane, it's better you take off every offer from your site if the seller is inactive. Why should I go through so much stress? This is only my second time trying to buy with kucoin and I'm 5 years frustrated. Please this nonsense have"
2024-03-11 11:10:32,A lot of spam e-mails and notifications. Sign-up rewards that can't be claimed because amount are random but just below withdrawal amount.
2024-03-20 14:23:17,I have never seen any app that's this cunning and embarrassing.... I made a transfer of over $100 out of this app only to get $30 on tje receiving app... This is REAPING in the highest order and nothing less.... Give me back my money @kucoin You need to shutdown cause you don't deserve to operate at all if this how you keep on reaping people off on this damn app
2024-03-28 20:15:12,I normally do not like ruining things with bad reviews. But I just hate you guys that much. Most disappointing trading platform ever. I don't even have the energy to say anymore. I'm done with you lot forever. Not that it'll affect you in anyway. Bye!
2024-03-25 18:30:35,"exhorbiant charges here, they only support deposit and withdrawal that will cost you a lot of money, imagine for btc witdraw $40 fee, and they won't support other network that offers less charges for same btc, also for sol they don't support other network that offers cheap fee, kucoin is too selfish something other exchanges support they will charge you highest fee and will only give one way no other options, so selfish exchange even launch pool they won't offer users, they are too greedy"
2024-03-29 05:14:09,Your ads show that this chain is good and beneficial for new user and they win many prizes but when using we find that they only show new people green garden... A complete waste of time
2024-03-22 15:04:42,"It's a beautiful app and easy to navigate. However, don't waste your time with their referrals and rewards, it's a shame. You will never get a dime"
2024-03-17 19:26:35,It's all good. The issue I faced was to bind my phone number. Anyone having this issue just login KuCoin through laptop or PC then bind your phone number through PC/Laptop and it'll be done in seconds. I guess app has some issue regarding binding of phone number. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
2024-03-26 11:02:47,"This app is a criminal app, the buy section in the p2p will show 1,429 and the sell section will show 2,000. So you will think that when you buy 1,429 you can sell for 2,000 and make profit , that is what they make me think, i bought usdt for 1,429 and I wanted to sell it for 2,000 after adding all the details and click the sell button the price will change automatically to 1200. If I want to buy the price will not change buy if I want to sell the price will change, I just lost a lot of money."
2024-03-19 18:31:02,"This remarkable application offers seamless transfer and exchange of cryptocurrencies across wallets, ensuring convenience for users. However, enhancing the depositing process for fiat currency would greatly improve accessibility for users globally."
2024-03-20 09:32:21,"I made 3 different transactions from different platforms to kucoin, none of them arrived. The worst thing is that only a bot responds with no answer at all."
2024-02-03 04:47:19,The app was working fine until the most recent update. It is now very slow when trying to view the market and has some bugs.
2024-04-12 17:37:54,Deleting this app Total scam rewards they imply huge gifts with impossible terms that eventually end with you losing more money.
2024-01-30 00:11:48,Don't use them ! They are scheisty ! I had sent some KCS and some pegged CRO KCC MainNet coins to an external wallet...They are not allowing me to send them back so I can sell them...The coins are on their network ! So now I am stuck with them and will lose...DON'T DEAL WITH THIS SHADY OPERATION! VERY BAD BUSINESS !
2024-03-15 19:11:12,"Its been a good experience until recently I find it difficult login in to my account. System error, timeouts is what I get. Please I need this fixed . Kucoin have been a good trading one for me. Restore things back plz."
2024-01-29 21:23:18,"I wish I could give a zero ‚≠ê. I have a pending issue regarding the withdrawal of my assets on kucoin and I was told to try again after few days. üò°üò°üò° Days have rolled into months, and yet, the fiat withdrawal issue I've still persists. Might I add that I've completed the highest level of KYC required by kucoin. I wish I never trusted them with my asset"
2024-03-02 00:02:28,"The said it will only take a few minutes to fully verify your account, but it's been hours. Very unreliable in terms of verification. Very bad experience. This app is a big ""NO""."
2024-02-02 16:10:51,I verified my account it went successfully they send me message that my account was verified after 3 to 4 hours they send me another message that verification failed . What a wasted time and data. Kucion work on your app like binance
2024-02-18 09:15:26,"The app has worked fine, on my S21. But last couple of months the update time is HORRIBLE. You need to shut down the app as prices are not upating in Real Time. Simply horrible. To have app for trading to act like this not even 1 * worth. Make the app better people you make more than enough from fees"
2024-03-15 12:57:22,The facial verification is awful. For over 30 minutes I have been trying to get verified for a transaction. I regret transferring into my wallet.
2024-02-18 12:06:21,"App never works, have to press each button 10 times, website version is also terrible, just copy and paste mexc or gate.io who do it right, you are losing trades because of it"
2024-03-17 22:23:14,"Worst crypto app ever My crypto is stuck in the wallet, I can't withdraw despite inputting the correct withdrawal password I can't log in even though I have a strong network connection Fix up your bugs I bought a coin on spot trading and till this day I got deducted but didn't see the coin I bought"

2024-03-09 14:30:30,"Getting verified is haaaaard. Other exchanges aeenway easier than this one, keeps saying my drivers license is blurry while othee exchanges have no problem. Whatever yah just lost a customer"
2024-02-06 11:22:09,"Support is non existing. All of a sudden deposits are refused and when you ask support why, they only tell you to buy crypto on p2p. It looks like you are only communicating with a computer program and if it is a human, his service is even worse than a computer program."
2024-03-09 14:28:51,"Always difficult to login, keeps sending verification codes via email in a never ending loop. Waste of time."
2024-03-04 02:53:52,Why does this app miss so many touches? It makes no sense. Tapping to open a chart is a game of hide and seek to find the ever changing spot that works. Why?
2024-03-01 03:50:54,"This is a very bad crypto app.. after making the first deposit they stopped sending verification code, I've been trying to withdraw still nothing. They are scammers beware The worst crypto app I've ever seen..."
2024-02-19 07:57:03,"Very bad experience, very slow layout and interface takes too long to display, and shows too many ads, A candle goes up or down, the order is not processed, dear team please improve kucoin app"
2024-02-01 09:03:22,New version looks awesome. Only thing I want is to be able to enable touch ID and pattern at the same time.

2024-03-17 19:11:17,"they always have issues with futures tab not loading properly, leaving your money frozen while others, spots, main tab, wallet all working properly, aside from that, they have higher funding rates than other platform"
2024-03-11 19:38:16,Please kucoin you need to make available the option for audio verification for we Nigerians. The SMS verification for withdrawal is not responding lately and it's really frustrating. Please we need urgent assistance.
2024-03-10 19:02:28,"I THINK THIS APP IS A SCAM, THE OPTION TO CONVERT VCORE BACK TO USDT IS NOT THERE. THEY ONLY ALLOWED ME TO BUY VCORE WITH MY USDT, NOW I WANT TO SWAP BACK TO USDT BUT THEY REFUSE TO LET ME. THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTING KUCOIN, I'M RATING YOU 1 STAR AFTER 24 HOURS YOU DON'T SOLVE THIS, I HAVE MORE THAN 1 THOUSAND FOLLOWERS WHO WILL DO THE SAME."

Worst trading platform ever!"
2024-03-01 22:26:50,I forgot my trading password. I cant change it because app does not recognise my face so I can't make authorization. It is one of more problems with this app
2024-03-13 19:47:47,"This app is worse, I have been making complaining for the past few days.. I can't receive sms code and I can't make withdraw because of trading password.. Your customer service is worst and I regret opening account. Nothing has been done ever since I made a complaint"
2024-02-07 09:55:38,"For registration, app asks for scanned id or password, drivers licence. Not even my bank app is asking that much. Be carefull if you decide to use it, I blocked them instantly, its very shady practice."
2024-03-11 20:47:53,"I tried numerous time to convert my usdt to SOL, kept saying, ""Transaction fair system busy"" I can't swap my token at all and this is really frustrating, this app needs more improvement"
2024-03-03 01:24:18,"My experience so far with Kucoin is not that bad till when I had P2P issue. The counterpart did not make payment till now. Later said he made payment but it failed.. and asked for order cancelation, till now KUCOIN kept mute, no action taken since 4days now. I'm just sick and tired üò´."
2024-02-05 11:55:24,Can't verify my account. It got stuck on identity verification. Update: verification is now fixed. Waiting for results.

2024-02-15 16:30:07,"Easy to use, easy to navigate and a very easy to understand crypto app for beginners willing to become pros. I Oluwaseyi Festus heartily recommend Kucoin."
2024-01-28 11:10:51,Kucoin apps is the best app that i used. Aside from manual . It has a bot that can be very useful if u dont want to use the manual trade..... Very usefull and recomended.
2024-04-07 07:58:29,"Excellent app but need to give some features like okx , avg cost , daily up and down price percentage."
2024-03-06 10:19:08,Couldnt pay with cards that WORKed for The competitors. And when trying to solve the issue.. Their customers suport √Æs slow. Wouldnt reccomend
2023-12-05 10:05:33,"Only 2 stars because the app is currently not responding on touch, you need to press multiple times to be able to navigate between coins. Functioned as it should until recently, but I saw others that complained about this, maybe the latest updates are the problem. Will update my review after the fix (the issue is only present on Kucoin app, on S23 Ultra)."
2023-12-19 02:12:20,"I have submitted the file for verification since four days but my verification has not been done yet. Four days ago I wanted to buy a coin but due to verification I could not buy it. Today that coin has gone to the top.

2023-12-28 05:02:57,"üòîFirstly, I want to tell u that this application is to hard for the biggner the interface is also not so pretty. I think you have to change your interface that connects peoples and feels friendly and easy to use. Their no bugs that fells pretty good, hope so you improve and make it easy to use and understand ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2023-11-15 12:20:09,"Trading on Kucoin Future feels strange, the liquid distance is very close, do they not provide cross positions or are they just isolated? and it also seems like there is a bug where the favorite token button doesn't work when you click it, For example, I wanted to delete a favorite and it was successful but it was still saved in my favorites"
2023-11-28 14:20:07,"KuCoin is one of the best crypto trading apps having rich functionality, and lacking only few features. I can recommend it in most cases except for manual trading. The most irritating issues for me are inability to watch executed orders in the order of their execution, limited filtering and ordering. Orders are shown in the order of creation, where an old recently executed one is listed below multiple newer but older executed orders, which makes manual long and middle-term trading hardly usable"
2024-01-03 12:54:23,"This app cannot handle users. It is 03/01/2024, bitcoin has dumped over 10% in minutes and the app cannot load my trading account. When i go to my futures account it works perfectly fine, but it wont load my assets and i cannot trade. My wifi has immaculate strength and it is definitely not the problem. It almost feels like they are doing that on purpose so you lose your money and/or don't profit from such volatile times in the market. I've been in the Crypto space for almost 3 years now."
2024-01-16 20:00:30,"Its overall a genuine exchange but i am facing a few issues. 1. The ""Trading password"", this is useless tbh, it creates more hurdles than efficiency specially in Volatile markets, we should be given an option whether to have it or not. 2. Trailing Stop (Spot Buy/Sell), i dont know whats the use of limit order placing after delta is met but their should be an option to buy/sell on market price as soon as trailing delta is met else one should stay awake just to change the limit which is stupid."
2023-11-02 05:33:29,"Allow us the room to stretch our stops... You liquidate very closely and quickly, too. It's annoying. Also, whoever came up with the password before order is a complete jerküëéüèº It makes no sense at all. Why is it then a market order when I'd spend an extra 20-30sec in a volatile market before placing the order, hence missing opportunities. Do Something about these, please."
2024-01-15 22:32:28,"As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, KuCoin is a cryptocurrency exchange known for offering a wide range of digital assets for trading. It provides a user-friendly interface, various trading pairs, and features like staking and lending. However, it's important to note that the cryptocurrency market and exchanges can evolve, and new developments may have occurred since my last update. Always check the latest reviews and security measures before engaging with any cryptocurrency platform"
2023-12-25 08:05:05,"The app does not send sms verification code to bind phone, withour this ypu can deposit through P2P. I have reported it to AI, email the issues got response but all useless nothing happened after trying all AI and the email instructed. I can not deposit and enjoy new user rewards. I can not withdraw, so whats the point in using this app."
2024-04-12 13:52:19,The worst app for crypto.Try Bybit or some other exchange but not this this is a scam exchange with scam coins. Don't trust this exchange.
2024-03-04 15:34:11,They delisted few tokens from their platform and didn't even notify me about it. Not using it anymore. Not trustworthy.

2024-03-12 04:35:18,This app takes so much unnecessary amounts of time to display every icon and coin have to wait like 2mins for everything in the app to fully boot before I can trade
2024-04-10 20:00:56,"Kucoin is a scam this is the second time I will made a deposit of btc and I wasn't credited I try to reach customer service it all fail, they don't do anything about it I'm done with scam App now."
2024-03-02 04:15:00,"I have deposited Solana from Binance to Kucoin. Apparently, Binance is not an accepted platform for transfer and they don't mention that anywhere during tranfer. After reaching out to support, they requested me for multiple video proofs and even after promising to pay the processing fee (80 USDT) and submitting multiple video proofs (as requested), they started ghosting me. Their customer support is not at all supportive and they don't respond to the emails. Feels like KuCoin is a scam platform"
2024-03-19 20:40:47,Very cool and dependable exchange. Only problem is the request for pass code for every trade you're entering or exiting
2024-03-27 07:55:41,Worst trading platform ever same position start in binance and kucoin. I also add tp/sl. It doesn't it tp and same time binance it tap. Lost more than 10 thousand usdt üò°

2024-03-31 21:26:24,I was unable to transfer coins out from Kucoin to other platforms. I tried many time for them to send me code but I didn't receive the Code.

2023-12-19 18:39:42,"The new trading screen layout is rather confusing and not as intuitive. The order book chart should be on same page as the order entry screen (buy, sell stop etc) so that one can see / visualize where the majority of the current orders are (on the order book chart) and set order/trade price accordingly. Things are all over the places, could not easily see where the orders placed, balance etc. Please bring back the old layout. Or give an option to choose between new and old layout. Thanks."
2023-10-27 12:04:25,"No othef crypto trading app forces the user to give trading password each time while they trade. The user will miss potential buy or sells opportunity. If withdrawal requires a password, that's a fair thing to ask. Trading password is the most irritating feature. At least user should be able to turn it off, if not needed."
2024-02-24 15:21:41,Great App to use to trade crypto but horrible customer support. They will stiff/charge you 80usd to return your crypto cause they dont support the network(manta) they accepted your [USDC] deposit on without any warning and for gas fee that cost them free on that network. Thats after talking to their support multiple times. There are better apps out there that wont extort you to get your money back.
2024-01-19 12:18:20,"I like the app, but I don't like this cheating with the reward program. It offers you reward but is almost no way to get it. I would like more transparency in reward program"
2024-03-03 18:00:48,"Not user friendly, too many ads and rewards system a joke. Was charged a 4% fee despite it saying 0.1 or 0.2% fees."

2024-04-01 16:23:16,Phone binding not working. Not getting verification code. And very complicated app
2024-04-03 03:46:20,User experience feels a lot better. There's some significant level of optimization.

2024-04-07 19:05:44,I didn't given a start it's a total time waste exchange with extra fees binance and okx is better than kucoin
2024-02-18 13:54:53,"Hey, this is a message to everyone. DON'T USE KUCOIN. They are a dodgy crypto exchange. I transferred a small amount of my Bitcoin into their platform (aka being promised a 10-700 USDT) spun some fake wheel on their website received a fake 25 USDT prize. I realized that this amount was fake and couldn't be withdrawn. So I decided to transfer my money (Bitcoin) out of KUCOIN to another address and they charged me 55 USD to withdraw 50 USD of Bitcoin. Theives. Would not recommend."

2023-12-05 23:34:19,I learned a lot with this exchange and made a pretty good amount. It keeps me alerted to anything I want and shows me what's being traded live. But I really like selling my own coins or loaning them for interest returns. (Edit) well I did love this app but now it's saying it won't work and I can't access my assets at all so..im pretty annoyed with it. Kind of a blind sided robbery
2023-12-19 01:43:47,"I think the app is not easy to use for noobs, because There are many buyers who click on the confirm payment button but in reality they do not pay anything..they just do it by mistake or out of discovery.I always try to message them but all these beginners do not pay attention to the chat messages..I file a dispute..it takes few days to solve the problem . Please improve the application so that chat messages are shown to the buyer at least in notifications. Improving the arrangement of button"

I need a help"
2024-01-10 06:09:15,So far I'm impressed with the ability to edit the price range of the bots which other exchanges don't have but what is lacking in kucoin spot grid bots is the ability to withdraw the grid profits from the bot without having to stop the bot. I'll change my review to 5 star if the option to withdraw profits is added
2024-01-12 18:21:19,It is really difficult to send coins from this wallet. I tried to withdraw if this wallet is reliable. I complied the code and 2p2. It's a hell really. Its not easy to withdraw or transfer. I have failed. It's not a friendly wallet!

2023-12-22 11:27:26,To complicated to use and not user friendly if you deposit money wrongfully you can't easily withdraw your money back to your bank account you have to read and watch so many YouTube videos just to find the right way to withdraw you money back en don't forget for each deposit you have to pay fees you always lose some money and it's not really easy to find any thing on the page so many kliks to find yourself or your info KYC ALL PERSONAL INFO should be in the profile section for easy finding

2024-03-03 16:38:05,After you logged me out of the app its still saying my password is incorrect even after I changed my password really bad app not recommend
2024-03-15 21:15:30,it has been more than 2 years I'm using this app. it has been a wonderful journey. the team are trying.
2022-05-04 16:33:54,"Overall experience is not bad but some features are not fully implemented. For example, when a user makes an order there is no means to double-check that order is what user intended to be. This feature is very useful and mobile app of Binance provides user with such experience. Also, starting from around several months ago, data of the chart, order book and trade log are not synchronized, especially, when switching between different time periods for the chart and this is a very big flaw."

Then i have to wait for that update to show in playstore and update it from there, then it works again. Until then i can't use the app. Can take a few days. Happens quite often, which is very frustrating. I'm not going to allow the app to perform updates, this sounds very unsafe. This has been going on since more than a year."

I have been trying to get my trading password changed for nearly two weeks now, which means I can't make any trades until it is fixed. I have provided all of the required security information, but they have been incredibly slow and unhelpful and just keep giving stock standard responses. Very disappointed. Would not recommend."
2022-06-15 18:18:28,"I love this exchange, on desktop! The app however can be a huge chore to use. For all intents and purpose, when it's working it's the best I've used but often it has issues crashing whenever volume gets crazy which doesn't happen on their desktop version, at least not for me. Edit: the crashing issue is little better, but now whenever I try to hold my finger on a particular bar on a chart to view the OHLC for that candle the info box only pops up for a tiny split second! It's SUPER frustrating!"
2021-05-01 00:05:17,"Amazing app but it would be great if you guys could add some features for the bots. Please add more configuration options for the bots. For instance, it would be nice to have a stop limit sell option for the bots to exit all positions once it reaches down to an undesirable price. Also, it would be much better to visualize the chart & current orders simultaneously while looking at the bot stats instead of having to constantly switch the screens back and forth"
