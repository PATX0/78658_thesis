2021-05-04,An array of coins to choose from. Only thing I can gripe about is.. that it was pretty difficult to learn how to use the app. But after messing around and learning to I became a pro. They have future trading which is definitely a plus. Tips for loading money: use an exchange you can buy crypto on like coinbase or crypto . Com and do a wallet to wallet transfer. I use algorand .. super fast transfer times. Don‚Äôt give up on the app.. you‚Äôll figure it out.. If you can‚Äôt.. maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be trading.. lol,5,4
2022-01-11,"He walked back his bad review because he owned his mistake. Funny because I did the same thing with Binance. I can totally relate. I got angry in the same fashion because this is complicated functionality coupled with highly emotional activity ( risking your hard earned money). Nice work Man taking the time to followup with some kindness and props where they are deserved. There are humans on the other end of these computers too I believe trying to help more often than not. Peace to you, Friend.",5,1
2021-11-14,"‚Äà‚ÄãThis exchange is one of the best in overall customer service, you get to chat with live humans not bots in minutes and they are very good at helping with any issues. You can also easily move your coins w low to no fees and if you need it back into fiat it only takes a few days vs weeks with some of the others. I‚Äôm a big fan and I highly recommend them over most all the other big exchanges. I‚Äôve tried them all!!‚ÄÇ‚Ää‚Äè‚Ää‚ÄÅ‚Äå‚Äã‚ÄÅ‚Äé",5,5
2021-10-09,"I downloaded this app and it looks great! Unfortunately, it does not support my country (United States). I found this out after searching specifically for KuCoin Us on the AppStore, signing up for an account and trying to go through KYC. All the best exchanges have no official US support and that‚Äôs sad. The rest of the world seems to be a lot more free than we are. Anyways, great product! I Hope to be able to participate someday, when my overlords decide to allow it.",5,4
2021-09-25,"Out of all the ones I‚Äôve tried; Binance, Webull, Robinhood, metamask, voyager and many more, KuCoin is the best!! Low gas fees, great charts, a ton of different stable coins and tokens to choose from. It‚Äôs completely eliminated the need to jump back and forth from one app to another to keep up with all my investments and favorite crypto. Only problem I‚Äôve had is trying to figure out my average price paid, for now I just keep up with it on a piece of paper ;)",5,5
2022-04-07,"KuCoin is my favorite exchange so far! The fees are so low that I‚Äôve never even noticed them. There are many good ways to earn with low risk. With all these ways to earn I‚Äôd like to suggest the app have a locked crypto feature. For example, the app would give you fake BTC too put into there bots. I know this app has potential but it‚Äôs very very hard to learn for beginners even with the tutorials and such.",5,5
2021-02-18,"This app has had many updates. The UI is slick and the app is smooth. There is solid volume on the coins they offer for trade. The trade fees are significantly less than coin base and the other big name companies. 

Of the bad reviews I read I no longer see the problems they described. Nor do I see any issues with instant price changing like one user suggested.

I am quite happy with the application.",5,5
2022-03-11,"I‚Äôve been using Kucoin for a few months. It is now my primary exchange. I find it‚Äôs the best option for the sheer amount of things they offer.
But recently I‚Äôve been having issues with the trading bots feature. Luckily right now I don‚Äôt have any money in them, because at least in the app it won‚Äôt load and open the feature. It worked a couple months ago but now it won‚Äôt.
I‚Äôd love if this could get fixed",4,3
2022-08-03,"This is by far my favorite exchange to date! I‚Äôd give it the 5 stars but they have to show me pnl graphs 

Update: new update to the app is awesome! I love the new look and feel! The new games are fun. My only issue still is you guys need to add a PnL chart. If a horrible app like BitMart can do it I would think you guys should have no issues. Please update the app to have some charts! Good work so far otherwise! Keep it up üëçüèª!!
Update: I‚Äôm no longer receiving sms alerts!",4,4
2022-06-15,I have used the app to buy crypto without problems. I cannot trade (or withdraw) because of the trading password which is highly improbable that I don‚Äôt know what it would be. I have tried FOUR times to reset the password and after taking 15-20 minutes each time to go through all the steps have been denied four times. I have also been through customer support three times with no resolving this issue. I might like to continue using the KuCoin services but something has to give‚Ä¶ will the give be me giving up?,2,1
2021-05-23,I love the trading bot feature.  I‚Äôve had a lot of success with it after only a months use.  It can be very confusing at first and the app seems overwhelming at times but after you play around with the app for a bit everything starts making sense and the layout is actually really nice.  Definitely worth the try. Especially for the bot.,5,5
2022-04-22,"The app overall is great and user friendly. Limited KYC so you don‚Äôt feel like they are invading your privacy which is great for crypto.
They just need to add a Stop loss or take profit future as you submit the order. Currently you can only do that after the position has been opened.
your order might get filled and get liquidated all over night, so I suggest canceling orders that haven‚Äôt filled before you sleep.",4,4
2023-04-29,I miss the completed trade option in trade information. Without this I have to sort through my canceled orders to find my completed trades. For those of us that take profits frequently it was so much easier to have that information to make a decision quickly whether or not to jump back in. Can you please bring this option back ?,4,2
2022-02-11,The previous version of your app was complicated and had a learning curve but it was still useful. The new version your app lacks basic utility. I don‚Äôt know to do basic tasks and you‚Äôve instead focused the app on useless and unwanted features. I highly recommend you do some UX research studies with newer crypto investors to improve the product if that is your goal. The only reason I‚Äôm giving 2 stars is because you left the option for me to go back to the old interface (oddly hidden within a random emoji)?!,2,2
2019-11-01,I have been using KuCoin for over two years now and they have been great. I have never had any issues they could not resolve in a timely manner. They are always gauging the customer health by sending surveys often. KuCoin is my favorite exchange. I just hope one day they are able to have bank deposit for their clients in the US. I wish them great success in the future. Keep up the great work !!!,5,5
2021-05-16,"I‚Äôve been looking for a good exchange to use for smaller cap alts and I‚Äôve been hearing about Kucoin lately. I downloaded it and explored the app for a bit. I tried to see if I could make a purchase, but the interface is too confusing. There‚Äôs way too much going on, it feels cluttered and overwhelming. I like the options that they have for coins, but that‚Äôs about it. If the devs work on this I might be willing to come back to it, until then I‚Äôll be sticking with Coinbase.",3,2
2022-05-13,Sell futures trades when we‚Äôre up sometimes it glitches out and doesn‚Äôt let u execute the trade this will make or break kucoin ppl are losing money when they can‚Äôt sell when their high up and they go down and get liquidated everything else is super trustworthy please fix futures ‚Ä¶.;(,5,1
2021-11-10,"The app use to work perfectly and since some updates either with IOS or the app itself, I‚Äôm barely able to use the app at all. The market data constantly fails to load now, and I‚Äôm not able to make spot trades, only futures trades. It always makes me take extra steps to verify myself now, which is annoying and a little shady. The constant marketing pop-ups and trading competition notices are also annoying. No, I don‚Äôt want to join your Margin Trading competition, for the love of God!",2,4
2021-05-19,"Note that this app will ask to access your photos. However, you will not be asked that until your first purchase. A problem with this is that allowing an app access to your photos generally allows access to all photos.

If the need for this access stems from identity validation, a more forthcoming approach where you are informed of this need early and asked to upload the needed ‚Äùproof‚Äù (whatever it is) would be much better from a privacy perspective.",2,3
2021-05-19,"I have been trying to sell my cryptos for a week and the entire time they‚Äôve been put ‚Äúin orders‚Äù and I‚Äôve been losing money because they haven‚Äôt sold for the past week. Do not download on your phone, there is too much on the interface and there is no way to actually look at the pending orders on the app. I have no experience with this site on a computer but from what I‚Äôve seen it looks better. Don‚Äôt trust this app on your phone if you plan on being active, otherwise, set up a trader bot and leave it.",1,1
2021-03-20,"I‚Äôm usually not a fan of lesser known exchanges or apps when it comes to finances but this app is amazing. You can buy almost any coin, unlike most exchanges, you can lend and earn high interest, it‚Äôs got a great trade bot feature that literally earns you profit from trading and it‚Äôs free. So many great features, I never write reviews but this app made me want to. I believe Kucoin will be very popular in a year or 2",5,5
2021-04-25,"KuCoin customer support hasn‚Äôt gotten back to me after almost a month. I‚Äôve tried a bunch of the other crypto exchanges and by far prefer KuCoin, for a number of reasons, but they still haven‚Äôt verified my KYC info after a month, so I can‚Äôt directly deposit fiat into my account. Instead I‚Äôve been paying fees to transfer crypto and it makes me more depressed each time üò≠",4,1
2021-08-27,"Don‚Äôt let the negative comments make up your mind for you. If you know anything about exchanges and trading crypto, you will definitely be a KuCoin fan. I‚Äôve trade with Binance, Coinbase, and every other platform available to US customers, and KuCoin is by far the best one. It also has a great variety of coins including the newer small caps that are primed to moon.",5,5
2021-12-28,"Overall I like using KuCoin. If I have any issues they have been quick to get back to me especially if I notify them on their official Reddit page. 
They have lots of coins and fair trading fees. 
I will continue to use them as my main exchange as long as they keep privacy and security number one.",5,4
2021-11-09,"I was missing a few deposits a few years ago .They got better for a little bit .But now They are starting to miss deposits again .And I have too submit a form every time to get it back it is time consuming. And some times they will give the Crypto too you sometimes they won‚Äôt 

Why can‚Äôt they give you all your crypto every single time",3,2
2023-01-18,"App is good, but gosh, why did you add this f** irritating ‚Äúyou may also like‚Äù screen into My Market‚Äôs Favorites?? With no close button! I want to have a quick glance at my fav list, not to  answer stupid popup screens. I can find coins by myself if I want to. One of few apps with just right ui, and even you had to ruin it.",4,3
2019-06-10,"Very secure crypto exchange to use, the online app makes it very easy to trade and I never had an issue with security.

KuCoin is consistently updating their exchange for the better.  I prefer KuCoin over many other extras they take security seriously and make users use multiple security features when making accounts.",5,5
2021-09-18,"I personally am an experienced trader, been using Coinbase for 4yrs and Gemini for about 1yr. I have to say, I didn‚Äôt like the Kucoin app at first, but after using it after some time, I like it way more than Coinbase/Gemini App. Kucoin‚Äôs charts are so much better and easier to use/analyze, placing orders to buy/sell is a lot faster. Good job kucoin!",5,5
2021-04-22,"They have the best customer support out of all the crypto exchanges I know. Same day support using their support chat, something major exchanges do not have. They are reliable and dependable and have proved more than enough times that customer satisfaction is their top priority. They get 5 stars from me üëç",5,5
2023-04-19,Updating/Deleted my bad review. Only feedback I have now as far as improving is that I think that the charting could be a little more aesthetic on the mobile app.. but I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre prioritizing things the way they should and focusing on things of more importance.,5,3
2023-01-18,It‚Äôs the best trading app for crypto  It‚Äôs easy to use and is reliable when all the rest are not . I‚Äôve used it for my trading for three years it‚Äôs just gotten better . I use this one because they‚Äôre alway getting better and  offer a great selection of trading options and products,5,5
2023-01-11,"I love kucoin I do- 4 starts only because I‚Äôm skeptical of all the exchanges, not just them. I haven‚Äôt had any complaints, I love the ability to margin trade- can‚Äôt do that on Coinbase! But I‚Äôm sure they have some withdrawal fees that are fairly standard but can be costly on apps like this if you are like me and only use it to trade with a small amounts of assets",4,4
2022-04-17,Either you have figured out time travel or I myself keep going back in time and returning.  15 minute candles disappear right in front of my eyes. What‚Äôs going on?  I‚Äôve never seen a candle disappear and reappear later.  Over and over all day.  Development team should look into it.  Unless that‚Äôs  what you‚Äôre trying to do.  I like this app when it works in real-time.  Weird right?,3,1
2022-04-12,"Yes all I guess is ok for holding coins but the futures is absolutely the worst thing I have ever used. I made $600 and my trading fee was like $30 , I was like ok that‚Äôs fine. When I would lose a trade, which everybody loses. You can‚Äôt win everything. Let‚Äôs say I lose $60, my trading fees are $30. What is this? I lose 120 , my trading fees are 180. How am I supposed to be successful trader if my loses are amplified by 30% or more. How can a trading fee for losing be that much?  Lol what a joke.",2,1
2021-12-29,"I was skeptical about KuCoin but I finally gave in and opened an account because of their wide range in penny cryptos
I transferred around $2,000 all was well then when the market took a dive I took a break and stopped watching my account for about a week or two, when i came back my account was gone all my cryptos and the money I had sitting in the account I tried resetting my password but it still wouldn‚Äôt let me log on and want me to sign up and create an account",1,1
2021-11-02,This is an amazing TOOL for trading crypto I wouldn‚Äôt trust hodling in kucoin like a wallet just yet I have other places I like to store my crypto and earn extra interest.

2021-02-21,"Please fix the market tab at the bottom. It doesn‚Äôt load the first time it‚Äôs selected. Have to tap on another tab then tap the market tab again to reload. Kinda minor but it would be nice to get that out of the way. Otherwise, app works fine!",5,3
2021-12-31,"If your plan is to trade your Cryptos this is your platform (friendly app) you‚Äôll have 100% of control of your money, limit orders and tons of way to increase your portfolio, also you‚Äôll find a lot of new projects launches here before than other exchanges üî•üí∏üöÄüåï",5,5
2022-01-01,"Crypto user since late 2019 (better late then never?) - (or still early?) I use many platforms daily. KuCoin is simply one of the best.

2023-01-20,"I‚Äôve been with KuCoin for a few years now learning how to buy and sell spot and leveraged positions through the crypto cycles ups/downs, they‚Äôve been fantastic to work with. I‚Äôve never had any issues with withdrawals or worrying about my funds being safe. Thanks KuCoin!",5,5
2021-05-16,I cannot see any numbers on anything that I have purchased. I have tried for a week to talk to support. I get no response from anyone. Not by email or online support. Only a bot. Please talk to me or fix this. I‚Äôm about to go elsewhere,5,1
2022-03-14,"I purchased crypto to have sent to another platform & I was told it would be processed within 30 minutes . I waited 3+ hours and nothing happened . I reached out to them as one of their FAQ instructed . Following me reaching out , they kicked me out of the app . I tried to login , I couldn‚Äôt . I reset my password and the app kept saying ‚Äúlogin denied‚Äù . I‚Äôve sent over 10 emails , nothing . 31 hours later , they fail to provide help or process my withdrawal . I completely lost all my money .",1,1
2020-10-31,I have been waiting over a month to receive a certain cryptocurrency I transferred into my account. The transfer was quite large and they are now claiming it will be just a few more days or longer they cannot tell me a specific date. The value of this cryptocurrency has since lost more than double it‚Äôs value in this time. They will offer no compensation for this while they are holding my money hostage. This is theft and I no longer trust this company.,1,1
2021-06-03,"It would be EXTREMELY useful to have the ave cost per coin in the assets area...if like to go to my assets, click xrp and be able to see how many coins I have, ave cost each, and the current market price. I also think the assets dollar amount needs to be graphed so we can see how it‚Äôs changed over time. Give great information overall but could be better",3,3
2021-03-14,"There were some troubles with logging in, and sometimes the app crashes but their most

2022-01-04,"I bought Sand at .11 and it went over $6. Then I lost it making a transfer and lost my mind. Had to realize I really only lost my initial investment but there was a learning curve. I will never make that mistake again, but I can‚Äôt be mad. I just keep reading and learning cause I want to participate!",4,2
2022-05-16,The app is amazing and you have everything you need but if you compare it to other trading platforms it just doesn‚Äôt have as many trading tools for it to be satisfactory like having access to a 2 minute chart and being able to edit indicators.,4,4
2020-09-08,In the new version you guys removed the lending button and now I can‚Äôt seem to find a way to look at a comprehensive list of all my outstanding loan orders / loans for all coins. I now have to go into each individual coin to look at each one. Kinda makes things much more time consuming to monitor everything :/,4,4
2021-03-13,"Glad that I followed my instincts to try kucoin first, even with just a small amount but 
look where it got me now... i am used to accessing their website thru may laptop but thanks to
their app, i can just check and trade on my phone anytime. great security feature too!",5,5
2021-06-14,"The support team either don‚Äôt care or just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve lost over $1K from a ridiculous glitch they have and 1) take over a week to answer, 2) keep asking for a screenshot which I keep sending and explain what happened, 3) start all over again because the ticketing system times out. NOW they have some stupid raffling section in their app which honestly shows what they think of their clients, a bunch of suckers. Go to binance if you can. *smh",1,1
2021-10-26,"My previous review reflected a login issue that seems to have been fixed. All is well and generally has been for me, but stability and dependability are key. Please strive to attain and keep those qualities, then 5 stars for sure!",5,4
2023-05-12,"Unless you‚Äôre ok with your trade positions randomly disappearing and your long positions sometimes being mislabeled as shorts (until you refresh several times), don‚Äôt use this app. It‚Äôs ok for buying spot but unreliable for trading because of so many technical bugs. Occasionally stops don‚Äôt trigger as well and if you bring any issue up to customer service they just respond with basic instructions on how to use their platform.",1,2
2021-11-24,"Kucoin has a great variety of coins but their app is awful. It is constantly logging you off during peak hours of market volatility, and also constantly crashing. They want you to get liquidating and I believe they set it up that way by constantly prompting you with trading passwords, glitching it‚Äôs charts, giving you constant connectivity issues. This app is awful and if you‚Äôre able to use anything else for futures or spot trading, please do so! Kucoin is a scam",1,1
2021-10-27,Please read all of the recent reviews. This is a complete scam app that will hold your assets and claim them to have gone missing. They have stolen thousands of dollars of crypto for me. Their customer service is nonexistent. There are 24 seven online support chat is a bot that redirects you to the same articles over and over again. Even after multiple direct emails inquiring about my withdrawal of my assets have gone on answered. Please do not spend a cent on this app or risk losing all,1,1
2019-06-18,"Not only is kucoin fast and secure, but it‚Äôs also a real joy to use. With their incentives for holding KCS, they even have a fee structure which outperforms almost all other exchanges which are available in the US. No KYC if you‚Äôre not doing large volume either. Big win for kucoin. 10/10",5,5
2021-05-25,"The transaction fees are fairly low, however the fees to take your coins off the platform are set arbitrarily.  For some people these fees can exceed half of the value of their purchased coins.  This has nothing to do with gas, as it is a flat fee.

Additionally, whenever I access the app, it scans my clipboard without permission.  Considering the service offered, this seems very shady.  I cannot disable it, nor is it integral to functionality of the app.",1,3
2021-12-18,"Great support team and CEO. 

I had a few issues with the app and they have been wonderfully handled, I could say that this is one of the best exchanges I have used in about 7 years of trading.

2022-01-21,I began using Kucoin 2 or 3 months ago to cash in some XYO for BTC and decided to keep a few assets of various small amounts of cryptos I get from reading to earn. It took 3 of us a couple of days to figure out how to complete one transaction. Completely lost and in need of tutorials and directions. Trial and errore is scary and could get costly. Other than that it seems like a great app.,3,2

2021-08-30,This app is the  best I‚Äôve found. Took some time to learn it(still learning). It‚Äôs not that difficult once you get the hang of it. Perp coins easily set margin with take profit and stop orders. Other little trinkets that pay 75%. Futures brawls it‚Äôs good times x 1000!!,5,5
2021-08-28,Put $50 into kukoin my account NOW sits on $500 never less. That does NOT include the nearly thousand that I‚Äôm allowed to borrow to wage with. Their lending and borrow makes KuCoin.

2022-07-29,"I downloaded this app because it was necessary to transfer over crypto to purchase a newer released coin.
The advertised cryptocurrency is limited in purchase options and was misleading enough, but because I sent less than a dollar to test your network, now i am unable to withdraw it because you have a transfer limit and a huge gas fee to top it off. Easily never using this app again with a small net loss",1,1
2023-03-04,This company offer cero support and make you really easy to deposit money but gos dare you you forget your trading password they will make you go thru hoops to then tell you one of the answer is incorrect and there is nothing they could do.

It took me another hour or so to figure out to buy and trade. Bad, just bad all around.",1,1

2021-08-30,"KuCoin is terrible. Their fine print is extremely difficult to read. When using their app to trade with futures leverage, it appears safe at first, but the invisible small print clearly shows if you don‚Äôt put in a stop order you lose everything and you might as well give up on life.

2022-11-13,Have you ever wondered why Kucoin constantly make these random tokens that you‚Äôve never heard of? Well they like to print out these random tokens and use them as collateral to borrow against them. So fake magic money going in the market and then they move the market to their advantage to take your funds. Something tells me they are insolvent but we will see in the next couple months.,1,1
2022-05-16,"Be careful trading with them. They will delist any token without sending out a common email. You will lose all your money if that token was only trading on KuCoin. Not professional at all.

How do you delist a coin without emailing your users? That‚Äôs what scammers do, they knew Tky was only trading on their market and figured a way to screw their users by delisting it without any warning. I dare one of their  useless team to respond. Dirty scammers",1,1

2021-02-11,You‚Äôll pay for coins but you won‚Äôt get any. And once you contact them then they‚Äôre going make up a reason and refund you the money. I‚Äôm sure they get away with keeping peoples money. To make a payment it redirects you to a company that no body has ever herd of and that‚Äôs shady. Why not take money directly from your platform? I have a feeling even if someone does get coins from kucoin they won‚Äôt be able to cash them out.,1,1

2022-03-14,Every time you open kucoin it reads your clipboard for ‚Äúno reason‚Äù but it‚Äôs probably looking for wallet passwords/backup codes you‚Äôve interacted with on your clipboard. There‚Äôs no reason for the app to be doing this and praise @apple for showing the notification when an app reads your clipboard. Leveraged futures trading also very sus. Likely algos to liquidate you more and pocket the spot different. Nothing like FTX. Smh,3,2
2022-01-28,I‚Äôve only used normal spot and certain bots. But cannot beat free deposits and low exchange fees. Like less than .5% and if someone holds KCS token fees are a bit less with a small bonus compounded daily. Flat rate transfers for all coins usually about $30. 500+ currencies to trade paired with stable coins/usdt/usdc/Btc/eth/kcs. I highly recommend KuCoin trading app on iOS.
