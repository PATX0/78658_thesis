2022-01-19 19:09:15,"Absolutely thoroughly disappointed with this app. I recently put £30 into my account with KuCoin in order to currency trade to find that it would let me take that original £30 back out of the app. I wanted to take it back out since I didn’t want to trade using KuCoin after reading the reviews and my mates telling me how terrible it is. This app also read your banking information and use it. I can’t even take the £30 out without putting more in so I put £30 more in and I still cannot take it out of the account. This needs to be resolved before I escalate the issue higher. Refund me please or help me resolve this issue. I’ve tried to withdraw it using the withdraw button and it doesn’t work at all because I haven’t traded anything but I don’t want to because I now use Coinbase.

Please please avoid this app at all costs, KuCoin you need to resolve my issue urgently as I’ve been reporting this for along period of time",1,FALSE,rugby man 03,Terrible
