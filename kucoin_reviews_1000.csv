I love the KuCoin application, it’s fast and the user interface is easy to learn and navigate. I like the fact that KuCoin makes it easy for me to pay for crypto with my debit card and the deposit is almost instant. However, I gave the mobile application a 3 star because it requires access to the photos stored on your phone to be able to buy crypto with fiat. This is a major turn off, there’s no reason for KuCoin to ask permissions to my photo album for me to buy crypto. I bypass this by going on their website using a PC, but it’s massively inconvenient. If they remove the need for the app to access my photo albums when trying to purchase crypto with my debit\credit card, I’ll update the rating to a 5 star.

2021-05-05 19:11:16,"Read the reviews and you’ll quickly notice a common theme.. user error and inexperience. Some guy complaining about bitcoin transfer not showing up 45 minutes later... bitcoin transactions can take an hour, sometimes more. Depends on the fee you paid to send and how busy the network is. You obviously never sent btc before. Another guy playing with margin, which is basically gambling by borrowing using your assets/crypto as collateral. You’re playing a dangerous game playing with margin, because you’re liable for losses when the market dips. You’re trying to make a profit by GAMBLING that the price will go up. If it doesn’t and you lose a certain percentage, the asset automatically sells itself to cover losses. This guy went ALL IN with more than he was comfortable losing, that’s YOUR FAULT! Why not just let your coins sit and grow? He lost his coins because the market dipped. You don’t play with that, it’s not because the app closed. That’s dishonest interpretation of what happened. This is exchange has been awesome so far. It’s not the A-tier exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, but it’s a solid B. The A-tier exchanges simply have more volume pumping through them, but in terms of usability and utility, ease of use, etc I give KuCoin an A+. Ppl who have left negative reviews are ALL mostly new to this space, chasing fomo, and they CLEARLY don’t understand this game yet. KuCoin has security hold protocols in place, especially for new users to avoid fraud. They don’t let you move assets right away when you make changes to your email or change a password, that lasts 24 hours or so. It gives the owner a chance to react to security alert emails/texts if anyone were to gain access to your account. These are smart moves to protect your account, crying about it just shows inexperience. I love KuCoin. It’s a great exchange for US investors. It’s not technically set up for US yet, but it doesn’t prevent us from investing. The only limitation is that you’re limited to withdrawing 2 btc per day, and for most ppl that’s plenty given we’re not all moving $120k per day!! Too much complaining from ppl who need to look at their own mistakes, and blame their own lack of knowledge/research.

You can trade, buy, withdraw INSTANTLY!!! No waiting for days or your account getting locked up for “security reasons”!!! KuCoin is the top exchange to use and they have such an amazing team that actually cares about their product & services. There are many similar to KuCoin but there really is only one like it and that’s being them ONLY. Give them a shot and you will see why they are leagues better than Coinbase, Kraken, etc. They also have their own NON-Custodial wallet with plenty of top of the line security, they offer staking & lending of popular coins, & you can trade with the lowest fees ever. Take back control of your assets and stop waiting forever and ever for other exchanges just for them to eventually bar your from your own assets. It’s been happening to the mightiest of exchanges so always be on the lookout and always remember, NOT YOUR KEYS THEN IT REALLY ISN’T YOUR CRYPTO.

At first I thought maybe my timing was bad, but every single trade I took the same result would happen, and if I waited to see if it would move before getting in, it would act like it was going to go my way, so then I’d buy in and then boom it would immediately try to liquidate me, seemed awfully sketchy to me as a bunch of people I’ve talked to have had the same issue.

They seem to have an automated ticket system that failed to acknowledge several of my email responses. I think I was able to finally get a message through to the system after they marked it as solved, but I now have little confidence that I’ll get any more help on my issue. 

I’m sort of a newbie to crypto trading, but I started using KuCoin to trade some X Y O that I mined in another app.  The KuCoin iOS (iPhone) app works fine.  All of the features function as described, and I have never experienced a crash or lost currency due to any malfunctions.  I’ve lost on bad trades, but that’s another story.  My biggest problem with the iOS app is size of the text.  They try to cram so much info onto the screen that the text get’s really small and hard to read.  SO, I decided to try the iPadOS version of the app on my 2020 iPad Pro.  The text is definitely easier to read, but the app only works in portrait view.  It will not rotate to landscape.  In that sense, it feels very much like an iPhone app that was hastily ported to iPad format.  Also, and this is the biggest issue for me, the trading bot simply does not work on the iPad.  I have waited weeks for responses from tech support, and the answer is simply to reinstall the app and try again.  I’ve tried that a number of times with no success.  All I get is an error message that it failed to load. I would really like to see landscape mode with full screen charts (like the website) on the iPad app, and it would good to get the bot working on the iPad.  If they do that, I’ll revise my rating.",1,False,iOS vs. iPadOS,ITABWODI,

I have NEVER used the website through a PC to place any trades, deposits - anything! I am accustomed to the mobile app, I like the mobile app and I will ONLY use the mobile app. At this point, unfortunately, I will be leaving the KuCoin platform. There was a time just weeks ago where I thought that this was the best cryptocurrency exchange that existed. Now? Due to this very, very annoying issue that should not even be existent, I am no longer a fan or supporter of KuCoin. I’ll be leaving the Reddit community and any other forum/platform/exchange associated in any way with the company.

I want to add that, particularly through Reddit, I have been an avid supporter of the platform. I’ve even had several short conversations with Johnny KuCoin who is the CEO of the company. He’s a very nice man and has always put my interest first in amending any problems I have had - which admittedly are rare. Upon emailing the company today though? I was given a response that essentially, in other words, said “oh well, you can’t use your phone I guess! Go buy a laptop and use our exchange through our website.”

This is a joke. Please, fix the problem or you lie at risk of losing supportive members of your community - the community you have worked tirelessly to build! 

I hope that Johnny_Kucoin sees this message. I hope that someone steps up to resolve the issue before KuCoin loses its ground to stand on. I checked social media and I am not the only person with the problem. As a matter of fact - and although I didn’t read them all - I picked through lists of articles/forum topics surrounding this dilemma that must have been numbered in the hundreds, if not thousands!

This is something that should be at the TOP of the priority list and I hope that KuCoin is able to prove why they are so beloved by the cryptocurrency trading community. Thank you for your time spent in reading this message. I know it was long but I wanted to make sure that all of the information given was clear. I look forward to hearing back from you as well as seeing this issue resolved.

TL;DR: Fix your 401 Network connection issues!! I lose money because I can’t close positions if I can’t connect and therefore can’t recommend!!!

Before I joined the app I shopped around to make sure the exchange/app was reliable and was a good experience. I saw raving reviews and was thoroughly impressed with how they handled the situation when they got hacked a few years ago. So I downloaded the app and signed up.

Initially the app is a confusing experience and not user friendly. However, as you navigate the app and spend more time in it the app makes more sense. The app and platform was a real 5 stars for me and I was recommending it to friends. I noticed however that every once in a while I would get 401 Errors or Network Connection issues. This happened sporadically and wasn’t game breaking.

What brings the app down to a 1 star is the fact that these errors have gotten worse and more pervasive even as I tried to “improve” my connection. I would try going to areas with better reception, no luck. I would restart the app, works maybe 20% of the time. I would restart my phone, works once and then stops working after you load the app again.

I had a position that, while risky, I was aware that it could have been liquidated. KuCoin sent me a message saying I was in danger of getting liquidated as the position had dropped. Great, but I couldn’t get do anything in the app to respond as it couldn’t  connect even though I had service. By the time I got on, through my computer, my position had already been liquidated and I lost all of my money. 

It has gotten so bad that I’m now not just considering but will move to a different platform. Fix it please, I really like the platform but the connection issues make it absolutely unusable and unreliable. Time is money and these connection issues cost me a lot of time and money.

Other issues include: Slow 2FA SMS, can’t go through KYC to unlock rest of features, missing features or not well explained, and generally slow loading times.",1,False,Love the Platform - Despise the Connection Issues,D.F.R. III,
2022-12-13 12:19:51,"I’ve used pretty much every trading app out there and have been trading crypto for several years now. Of all the trading apps this one is by far the shadiest and I assume just preys on people who don’t understand the difference between limit and market orders. 

Whenever I place a limit order the purchase order will fill 1% + every single time. This basically means they are skimming (stealing) 1% on every order. This may not seem like a lot but keep in mind that if you use margin, say 20x you are already -20% as soon as your order fills. This is the first way I noticed this app stealing from me. The second way was on stop losses. 

The stop loss feature is labeled just that. It is not labeled a Limit Stop Loss. Multiple times my trigger price would hit and the stop loss would not trigger at which point I was liquidated shortly after. I split test this and it happened multiple times. 

The final way this platform robbed me was when I tried to get my money off the exchange and back to my Binance account. The transfer out would not and still will not go through after multiple attempts. Again, I’m not ignorant to trading and crypto wallet / platform transfers. This app isn’t having errors it’s designed to do all of these things and I’m sure scrapes millions per week from users who don’t understand functions. 

Lastly when I inquire for help all I get is automated responses that are absolutely useless and don’t even add the inquiry. Luckily I only moved like 1k over here to try it out simply because they had some very low cap projects I was interested in but that’s still a 1k loss now even though I didn’t loose it trading. Please don’t use with extreme caution and don’t move any funds over here you’re not willing to flush down the toilet.

They manipulate their charts and their prices not to mention the percentage increase or decrease for 24 hour periods most of their contracts are front running especially their KuCoin smart chain House token. 

Don’t even get me started on their futures or margin trading. Let’s just put it this way any money you put in there do not expect to get back. It is specifically designed to make sure that you withdraw zero money. The futures market or downright criminal. I’ve been trading futures for over 20 years very successfully seeing as it’s part of my career, and I’ve never seen anything as efficient as this app for robbing you of your money. Their liquidation engine is literally just a bought that tracks your orders and what it would take to liquidate you and even if you close out in a profitable spot you will come up negative. 100% of the time.

 These guys are a Hong Kong headquartered company, these Chinese nationals will steal your money and there’s nothing you can do about it. I have also had a referral of mine lose $250,000 because they locked him out of his account. $250K gone because they wanted to take it. 

I have several videos of questionable, at best, price action & also have several screenshots & testimony from a close friend who lost $250K trying to talk to customer service to get money back. I can verify anything & everything that I have said here with pictures, correspondence from KuCoin, and verification on block chain. 

Do yourself a favor especially if you are a US citizen, do not put any money in this exchange. Unless you want to lose it. Anybody you see you leaving a positive review of more than one star on this app is definitely a fake review from one of these Chinese nationals “Working” at KuCoin to steal your money. These guys are subhuman scum, don’t do them the service of giving them your money.
